order board tdd unit and cucumber tests have been implemented during the development all supported features of the order board are documented as cucumber features srctestresourcesfeatures implementation decisions : each order board instance can only store either sell or buy orders not both the assumption for that decision is that there will be a ui component which takes care of sell orders and another one which takes care of buy orders each ui component then can create the order board for orders of the type it needs : orders have strongly typed quantities with units and prices with currencies it was assumed that this is an international company and orders can have different units and currencies depending on the region where the board is used alternative : not having units and currency in the order and let the client make sure the orders always have the the same unit and currency this could cause mixed up units and currencies and could result in wrong calculations : the order board is also strongly typed meaning during creation of an order board the quantity unit and currency has to be specified when adding new orders the board will check that the order's unit and currency matches the one from the board alternative : same as for the order and not managing units and currencies in the order board to avoid mixed up orders in different units and currencies the decision was made to make the board strongly typed

implemented the following framework using apache spark streaming kafka elasticsearch and kibana the framework performs sentiment analysis of particular hash tags from the twitter data in real time for example i did the sentiment analysis for all the tweets for trump obama and show them e g positive neutral negative etc tweets on a map while showing tweets on a map i plotted them using their latitude and longitude sentiment analysis framework : scrapper kafka sentiment analyzer + spark streaming visualizer elasticsearch + kibana the above framework has the following components : scrapper : the scrapper collects all tweets and sends them to kafka for analytics the scraper uses a standalone program written in java and performs the following : a collects tweets in real time with particular hash tags for example all tweets with trump obama b after getting tweets they are filtered based on their latitude and longitude if any tweet does not have latitude and longitude they are discarded c after filtering they're sent tweets with latlng to kafka d used kafka api producer in this program e the scrapper program runs infinitely and takes hash tag as input parameter while running kafka installed kafka and run kafka server with zookeeper you should create a dedicated channeltopic for data transport sentiment analyzer sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive negative or neutral it's also known as opinion mining deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker for example president donald trump approaches his first big test this week from a position of unusual weakness has positive sentiment trump has the lowest standing in public opinion of any new president in modern history has neutral sentiment trump has displayed little interest in the policy itself casting it as a thankless chore to be done before getting to tax cut legislation he values more has negative sentiment the above examples are taken from cnbc news : used a third party sentiment analyzer like stanford core nlp javascala nltk python for sentiment analyzing added stanford core nlp as an external library using sbt maven in my scalajava project sentiment analysis using spark streaming : in spark streaming created a kafka consumer shown in the class for streaming word count and periodically collected filtered tweets from scrapper for each has tag performed sentiment analysis using sentiment analyzing tool discussed above then for each hash tag sent the output to elasticsearch for visualization visualizer installed elasticsearch and kibana created an index for visualization created a map to show all kinds of tweets after that created a dashboard to show the map dashboard requires data to be time stamped so when data was sent from spark to elasticsearch added a time stamp in the dashboard set a map refresh time to 2 min as an example tweets were shown for different categories for example if we have two hash tags obama and trump used different color icons for showing them in map used small circle with different colors for showing tweets

grandfathered projects often change hands and providers shut down parse is an example of this while this example might not be the best as parse can still be deployed in an open source incarnation this project aims to explore the possibility of migrating users from one backend to another as painlessly from a user's point of view as possible the problem for security passwords are never at least by anyone reputable stored as plain text and are usually hashed to avoid the use of the use of rainbow tables https : en wikipedia orgwiki rainbow this is a fairly common algorithm and would typically make a migration simple but it is not to say that a target backend would necessarily use the same hashing algorithm theory this experiment aims to find a method of migrating users whose passwords are encrypted with a certain hashing algorithm to a backend that makes use of a different hashing function difficulty also is introduced when selecting a hashing algorithm not all are secure in light of its vulnerabilities being exposed earlier this year we will most definitely not be using sha1 the manner in which we will try to accomplish this is by creating a new password for each user in a computable yet secret manner and encrypting this password with the new backend's hashing algorithm the old backend's password will still be stored in the users records on the new backend's database this will allow us to make the migration to the new backend almost invisible from the user's perspective when signing in the migrated user will enter their email address and password which will be used to : : check if the user is migrated : compute their migration password and sign in once successfully logged in the password the user entered will be compared to the hash representing their old password if this comparison fails the password can be seen as not matching if the comparison is successful the passwords match and the user's password on the backend will be updated to match whatever they entered as their password on the initial migration background this is not the first time that i have attempted to solve this problem though there were some rather large flaws in my previous approach as i am sure there are in this one these included : : using one master password for all migrated users : leaving this password in plain text in the application in which the solution was implemented : checking the file and all related secrets into version control as is to fix this the outlined approach : : uses a secret that is defined by the developer when they run through the process : hides the secret key in an environment variable in the android sample application in a that isn't checked into version control : computes a unique password for each user instead of using one password for all decreasing the chances of compromising all migrated users in one fell swoop expected procedure the expected process can be shortly and roughly expressed as : not real string email user@something com ; string password password ;

problems targeted : with the growing unpredictabilty of arrival and departure times of indian railway trains hence hampering the travellers schedule we have come up with a solution wherein customers can behorehand get the predicted timings of arrival of any future train this is a huge problem when considered running trains in india specially and needs to be solved with machine learning finding its applications in almost all fields is yet to be implemented in such a scenario for welfare of travellers we think our project could be a spark for starting work in this field description : we have designed an android application which actually predicts the delay time and henceforth the arrivaldeparture time of a future train this could be achieved by collecting real data of trains which ran previously for this we made a web crawler which actually helped us to crop down real data from net feature engineering : on crawling real data from net we sat back to think of features which alter on every particular run of any train in india major train delay issues happen due to weather and climatic conditions for which we also crawled real data from net and took it into consideration also railway traffic remains a major factor which we werent able to inculcate in our model although this could have been a good area to work upon but due to lack of time we limited ourselves to only considering climatic conditions of every stop of that particular train training and testing : after getting the appropriate data with delay times of every run we started our modelling by trying some machine learning algorithms to train data after trying almost all models we settled with linear regression for predicting delay times the training data had data of all trains that ran in 2016 constraints on input : we have only included the booking dates of march 2017 and that to for mumbai to delhi nzm future work : this could be expanded to all trains and an app could be built wherein customer puts source name destination name and date and the app shows a list of trains on that date with an extra column containing predicted timings of every train also this could be linked to irctc for further ticket bookings steps to run the project : 1 install the apk file cliser apk on any android device with android version 4 4 0 or higher 2 install these python libraries numpy pandas and scikit learn 3 keep the server py and ngrok exe files in any suitable location on your computer and go to that location on cmd 4 start the server in cmd using the command python server py port_no 5 in another cmd window run the following command to bring the localhost server online : ngrok http port_no 6 enter the address provided by ngrok in the app in suitable format 7 now enter the train number and date of journey in suitable format in the android app and press the run button 8 wait for sometime the message will be displayed in place of the result text below the run button depicting the predicted delay team members : 1 ankush patel 2 suraj tripathi 3 ujjawal prasad

the bodge it store is a vulnerable web application which is currently aimed at people who are new to pen testing this is a standalone distribution of the bodge it store which uses maven to build a runnable war : mvn package java jar targetbodgeit regression runnable 1 0 snapshot war note that the bodge it store is now available as a docker image : some of its features and characteristics : : easy to install just requires java and a servlet engine e g tomcat : self contained no additional dependencies other than to 2 in the above line : easy to change on the fly all the functionality is implemented in js ps so no ide required : cross platform : open source : no separate db to install and configure it uses an 'in memory' db that is automatically re initialized on start up all you need to do is download and open the zip file and then extract the war file into the webapps directory of your favorite servlet engine then point your browser at for example http : localhost : 8080bodgeit you may find it easier to find vulnerabilities using a pen test tool if you dont have a favourite one i'd recommend the zed attack proxy for which i'm the project lead the bodge it store include the following significant vulnerabilities : : cross site scripting : sql injection : hidden but unprotected content : cross site request forgery : debug code : insecure object references : application logic vulnerabilities if you spot any others then let me know ; there is also a 'scoring' page linked from the 'about us' page where you can see various hacking challenges and whether you have completed them or not in the relatively near future i'm hoping to add things like : : ajax requests : more vulnerabilities of course you can now also perform automated security regression tests on the bodge it store see the wiki any feedback or offers of help to develop it further; would be appreciated bodgeit maven

bowling game kata create a program that takes a valid game of bowling as a list of rolls and returns this is a good opportunity to practice tdd https : en wikipedia orgwiki test driven_development the rules of bowling can be summarized as : each game includes ten frames for the bowler the game score is the total of all frame scores in each frame the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down a total of 10 pins if in two tries she does not knock all 10 pins down her score for that frame is the total number of pins she knocked down in her two tries if in two tries she knocks all 10 pins down a spare her score for the frame is ten plus the number of pins knocked down on her next throw : i e : her first throw of the next frame if on her first roll in a frame she knocks down all 10 pins a strike she does not take a second roll in that frame and her score for the frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in her next two rolls if she gets a spare or strike in the last tenth frame she gets to throw one or two more bonus balls as appropriate if the bonus throws knock down all the pins the process does not repeat : the bonus throws are only used to calculate the score of the tenth frame it might be a good idea to start by assuming the following : it is not necessary to provide scores for intermediate frames : i e : the score of the game before the game is finished we will only receive valid input once you are done it is worth trying to drop these assumptions thanks to uncle bob also ron jeffries and the coding dojo

guesser agent for the essence taboo challenge taboo is a word guessing game in which one player has to describe a target term to another player by giving hints that are neither the target term nor other terms specified in a predetermined list of taboo words for example a player might have to describe water without using sea blue or beverage the location taboo challenge ltc which has been proposed by the essence marie curie initial training network is a version of taboo that only contains cities as target terms and is intended to be played by artificial guesser agents in the ltc the hints which are words associated to the target city are sequentially provided to the guesser agent and the goal is to guess the target location as soon as possible a complete specification of the challenge can be found here this repository provides the code of a guesser agent presented in a workshop paper this readme will guide you in the installation of the agent presentation of the taboo game an ltc game is played by two agents the describer and the guesser the game starts with the describer providing a hint about a particular city anywhere in the world based on this hint the guesser tries to guess the city that is being described there are two possi ble outcomes after a guess has been made for the outcome where the guess is correct the game is considered to be successful however for the outcome where the guess is incorrect the describer provides another hint and the game continues until the describer has consumed all the hints the lt challenge consists of implementing a guesser agent that can guess the correct city using the fewest number of guesses possible and before the describer runs out of hints in the case where the describer runs out of hints and the correct guess has not yet been made the game is considered to have failed for the ltc the describer agent is provided by the authors of the challenge and the hints are crowd sourced from real games played by human players therefore the length of a game i e the number of hints is not fixed but determined by the individual players also it should be noted that the real world dataset which is pro vided by essence network consists of only successfully finished games after each guess the describer provides not only a new hint but also the city that the human player wrongfully guessed this information may be useful or even necessary in order to interpret

pie message i message on android this is project allows android clients to communicate using i message video demonstration a href target _blank img src alt image alt text here width 240 height 180 border 10 disclaimer this project is a super alpha prototype i am releasing it because i need your help : about there are 4 parts to the pie message project : : messages applescript : : : : java web server jws : : : : osx client : : : : android client : : the messages applescript messages applescript is arguably the most important part of the project it is what makes sending i messages possible this script is what sends an i message message the osx client pie osx client &amp; jws java web server run on any osx machine macbook mac etc if the osx client pie osx client detects any changes to the messages sqlite database file where a new message has been received it will send the jws a socket : 'incoming' : json message incoming messages are detected from a change from the sqlite chat db of the 'messages' app whose default location is ~library messageschat db i have provided a database schema to help visualize the database in the pdf messages schema pdf messages schema pdf the jws java web server is what connects the osx client to the android client if the jws receives a socket 'outgoing' json message from the android client it will pass it to the osx client to tell it to send the i message that was requested from the android if the jws recieves a socket : 'incoming' : json message from the osx client it means the osx client has detected a new message and wants the jws to notify the android client the android client pie message android connects to a socket that whose ip address is of the osx device that is running the jws and osx client it then sends json messages to the jws using that socket it also receives json to show in list of any new incoming i messages requirements osx device public ip for osx device i cloud account w i message enabled java jdk android device 4 0+ optional requirement intelli j idea android studio set up 1 open the messages application and add your i cloud account in messages preferences accounts 2 clone the pie message project onto your osx device 3 edit the : socket address : value in pie osx clientsrc constants java pie osx clientsrc constants java to your public ip address that is linked to your osx device you can do either terminal or gui setup from here if you will be working on this you will eventually need to set it up in intelli j android studio or get it to work in your ide of choice via terminal 1 2 in one terminal windowscreen : this will need to remain open 3 in another windowscreen : this will need to remain open 4 in a final windowscreen : this is simply to compile and load the application via gui 1 move messages applescript messages applescript to your ~ home directory users 2 open the java web server java web server as a project in intelli j run the server java web serversrc server java class 3 open the pie osx client pie osx client as a project in intelli j 4 run pie osx client pie osx clientsrc pie osx client java class 5 open pie message android pie message android as a project in android studio 6 compile apk to any android device wish list since i've moved onto other projects and haven't had time to finish this there are few things that wanted to implement it would be nice to combine the osx client and the jws also the osx client sometimes timesout and loses socket connection over a 2 hour+ period i'm not sure if this is my own internet the osx it self also it is possible to recieve group messaging just not send it unfortunately i couldnt figure out an applescript to send to multiple clients in a single conversation thread you definitely can send multiple : individual : messages at once but that still isn't in the same conversation thread the only reason why we can receive is because it's just a chat table in the sqlite database on the osx device photo video messages are definitely possible too there is a place in the sq lite table named : message_attachment_join : and : attachment : it just has to link that in some kind of protocol for the osx jws and android client to implement there can be clients for any platform like windows web black berry os windows phone a toaster etc since the jws and osx client just take in a json to send &amp; receive one just has to implement a client that is similar to the way the android client communicates with it

the splunk software development kit for java version 1 5 0 the splunk software development kit sdk for java contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to build applications using splunk splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed map reduce architecture to efficiently index search and process large time varying data sets the splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and monitoring of it machine data security compliance and a wide variety of other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index search analyze and generate real time notifications from large volumes of time series data the splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the same technology used by the splunk product to build exciting new applications that are enabled by splunk's unique capabilities getting started with the splunk sdk for java the splunk sdk for java contains library code and examples that show how to programmatically interact with splunk for a variety of scenarios including searching saved searches data inputs and many more along with building complete applications the information in this readme provides steps to get going quickly but for more in depth information be sure to visit the splunk developer portal requirements here's what you need to get going with the splunk sdk for java splunk if you haven't already installed splunk download it here for more about installing and running splunk and system requirements see installing &amp; running splunk splunk sdk for java get the splunk sdk for java the sdk as a zip then extract the files and build the sdk or download the jar and add it to your project if you want to contribute to the sdk clone the repository from git hub java and ant you'll need java se version 6 or higher which you can download from the oracle web site you'll also need ant which you can install from the apache website the splunk sdk for java is compatible with java 8 be aware that : : java 8 disables secure sockets layer version 3 ss lv3 by default : : so you will need to use transport layer security tls instead to see an example of how to do this see the example alternatively you can re enable ss lv3 in java settings but this is not recommended if you are using windows you'll need to make sure the following system variables are created and set : : : : ant_home : : should be set to the location where ant is installed : : : java_home : : should be set to the directory where the jdk is installed : : : path : : should include the path to the : : %ant_home%\bin : : directory for full installation instructions you can find more information here : : java platform installation : installing apache ant building the sdk and documentation to build the sdk open a command prompt in the : : splunk sdk java : : directory and enter : ant or ant dist this command builds all of the class and jar files if you just want to build the class files enter : ant build to remove all build artifacts from the repository enter : ant clean to build the documentation for the sdk enter : ant javadoc examples and unit tests the splunk sdk for java includes several examples and unit tests that are run at the command line set up the splunkrc file to connect to splunk many of the sdk examples and unit tests take command line arguments that specify values for the host port and login credentials for splunk for convenience during development you can store these arguments as key value pairs in a text file named : : splunkrc : : then the sdk examples and unit tests use the values from the : : splunkrc : : file when you don't specify them to use this convenience file create a text file with the following format : splunk host default : localhost host localhost splunk admin port default : 8089 port 8089 splunk username username admin splunk password password changeme access scheme default : https scheme https your version of splunk default : 5 0 version 5 0 save the file as : : splunkrc : : in the current user's home directory : for example on mac os x save the file as : ~ splunkrc : on windows save the file as : c : \users\currentusername\ splunkrc you might get errors in windows when you try to name the file because splunkrc looks like a nameless file with an extension you can use the command line to create this file&mdash;go to the : : c : \users\currentusername : : directory and enter the following command : notepad exe splunkrc click : : yes : : then continue creating the file : : note : : : storing login credentials in the : : splunkrc : : file is only for convenience during development this file isn't part of the splunk platform and shouldn't be used for storing user credentials for production and if you're at all concerned about the security of your credentials just enter them at the command line rather than saving them in this file run examples after you build the sdk examples are put in the : : splunk sdk javadistexamples : : directory to run the examples run the java interpreter at the command line using the flag to specify the target example jar file and include any arguments that are required by the example to get help for an example use the argument with an example for example to see the command line arguments for the search example open a command prompt in the : : splunk sdk java : : directory and enter : java jar distexamplessearch jar help to run the search example open a command prompt in the : : splunk sdk java : : directory and enter : java jar distexamplessearch jar search : head 10 output_mode csv there is also a helper script called run in the root of the repository that simplifies running the sdk examples for example on mac os x you could simply enter : run search search : head 10 output_mode csv all the the example jars are completely self contained they can be used completely independently of the sdk's repository run unit tests to run the sdk unit tests open a command prompt in the : : splunk sdk java : : directory and enter : ant test to run the units from anywhere in the repository enter : ant test find you can also run specific test classes by passing the class to the dtestcase option e g ant test dtestcase atom feed test the ant configuration can also produce a single html report of all the tests run using the target testreport which also understands the dtestcase option e g ant testreport the report will be written in buildreportstestsindex html it's also possible to run the units within java id es such as intelli j and eclipse for example to open the splunk sdk for java project in eclipse : 1 click : : file : : : : import : : 2 click : : general : : : : existing projects into workspace : : then click : : next : : 3 in : : select root directory

gradle for android and java final project in this project you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and google cloud endpoints the finished app will consist of four modules a java library that provides jokes a google cloud endpoints gce project that serves those jokes an android library containing an activity for displaying jokes and an android app that fetches jokes from the gce module and passes them to the android library for display why this project as android projects grow in complexity it becomes necessary to customize the behavior of the gradle build tool allowing automation of repetitive tasks particularly factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity what will i learn? you will learn the role of gradle in building android apps and how to use gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity you'll learn to : : add free and paid flavors to an app and set up your build to share code between them : factor reusable functionality into a java library : factor reusable android functionality into an android library : configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app : use the gradle app engine plugin to deploy a backend : configure an integration test suite that runs against the local app engine development server how do i complete this project? step 0 : starting point this is the starting point for the final project which is provided to you in the course repository it contains an activity with a banner ad and a button that purports to tell a joke but actually just complains the banner ad was set up following the instructions here : you may need to download the google repository from the extras section of the android sdk manager when you can build an deploy this starter code to an emulator you're ready to move on step 1 : create a java library your first task is to create a java library that provides jokes create a new gradle java project either using the android studio wizard or by hand then introduce a project dependency between your app and the new java library if you need review check out demo 4 01 from the course code make the button display a toast showing a joke retrieved from your java joke telling library step 2 : create an android library create an android library containing an activity that will display a joke passed to it as an intent extra wire up project dependencies so that the button can now pass the joke from the java library to the android library for review on how to create an android library check out demo 4 03 for a refresher on intent extras check out; step 3 : create gce module this next task will be pretty tricky instead of pulling jokes directly from our java library we'll set up a google cloud endpoints development server and pull our jokes from there follow the instructions in the following tutorial to add a google could endpoints module to your project : introduce a project dependency between your java library and your gce module and modify the gce starter code to pull jokes from your java library create an async task to retrieve jokes make the button kick off a task to retrieve a joke then launch the activity from your android library to display it step 4 : add functional tests add code to test that your async task successfully retrieves a non empty string for a refresher on setting up android tests check out demo 4 09 step 5 : add a paid flavor add free and paid product flavors to your app remove the ad and any dependencies you can from the paid flavor optional tasks for extra practice to make your project stand out complete the following tasks add interstitial ad follow these instructions to add an interstitial ad to the free version display the ad after the user hits the button but before the joke is shown add loading indicator add a loading indicator that is shown while the joke is being retrieved and disappears when the joke is ready the following tutorial is a good place to start : configure test task to tie it all together create a gradle task that : 1 launches the gce local development server 2 runs all tests 3 shuts the server down again rubric required components : project contains a java library for supplying jokes : project contains an android library with an activity that displays jokes passed to it as intent extras : project contains a google cloud endpoints module that supplies jokes from the java library project loads jokes from gce module via an async task : project contains connected tests to verify that the async task is indeed loading jokes : project contains paidfree flavors the paid flavor has no ads and no unnecessary dependencies required behavior : app retrieves jokes from google cloud endpoints module and displays them via an activity from the android library optional components once you have a functioning project consider adding more features to test your gradle and android skills here are a few suggestions : : make the free app variant display interstitial ads between the main activity and the joke displaying activity : have the app display a loading indicator while the joke is being fetched from the server : write a gradle task that starts the gce dev server runs all the android tests and shuts down the dev server

gradle for android and java final project in this project you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and google cloud endpoints the finished app will consist of four modules a java library that provides jokes a google cloud endpoints gce project that serves those jokes an android library containing an activity for displaying jokes and an android app that fetches jokes from the gce module and passes them to the android library for display why this project as android projects grow in complexity it becomes necessary to customize the behavior of the gradle build tool allowing automation of repetitive tasks particularly factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity what will i learn? you will learn the role of gradle in building android apps and how to use gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity you'll learn to : : add free and paid flavors to an app and set up your build to share code between them : factor reusable functionality into a java library : factor reusable android functionality into an android library : configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app : use the gradle app engine plugin to deploy a backend : configure an integration test suite that runs against the local app engine development server how do i complete this project? step 0 : starting point this is the starting point for the final project which is provided to you in the course repository it contains an activity with a banner ad and a button that purports to tell a joke but actually just complains the banner ad was set up following the instructions here : you may need to download the google repository from the extras section of the android sdk manager when you can build an deploy this starter code to an emulator you're ready to move on step 1 : create a java library your first task is to create a java library that provides jokes create a new gradle java project either using the android studio wizard or by hand then introduce a project dependency between your app and the new java library if you need review check out demo 4 01 from the course code make the button display a toast showing a joke retrieved from your java joke telling library step 2 : create an android library create an android library containing an activity that will display a joke passed to it as an intent extra wire up project dependencies so that the button can now pass the joke from the java library to the android library for review on how to create an android library check out demo 4 03 for a refresher on intent extras check out; step 3 : create gce module this next task will be pretty tricky instead of pulling jokes directly from our java library we'll set up a google cloud endpoints development server and pull our jokes from there follow the instructions in the following tutorial to add a google could endpoints module to your project : introduce a project dependency between your java library and your gce module and modify the gce starter code to pull jokes from your java library create an async task to retrieve jokes make the button kick off a task to retrieve a joke then launch the activity from your android library to display it step 4 : add functional tests add code to test that your async task successfully retrieves a non empty string for a refresher on setting up android tests check out demo 4 09 step 5 : add a paid flavor add free and paid product flavors to your app remove the ad and any dependencies you can from the paid flavor optional tasks for extra practice to make your project stand out complete the following tasks add interstitial ad follow these instructions to add an interstitial ad to the free version display the ad after the user hits the button but before the joke is shown add loading indicator add a loading indicator that is shown while the joke is being retrieved and disappears when the joke is ready the following tutorial is a good place to start : configure test task to tie it all together create a gradle task that : 1 launches the gce local development server 2 runs all tests 3 shuts the server down again rubric required components : project contains a java library for supplying jokes : project contains an android library with an activity that displays jokes passed to it as intent extras : project contains a google cloud endpoints module that supplies jokes from the java library project loads jokes from gce module via an async task : project contains connected tests to verify that the async task is indeed loading jokes : project contains paidfree flavors the paid flavor has no ads and no unnecessary dependencies required behavior : app retrieves jokes from google cloud endpoints module and displays them via an activity from the android library optional components once you have a functioning project consider adding more features to test your gradle and android skills here are a few suggestions : : make the free app variant display interstitial ads between the main activity and the joke displaying activity : have the app display a loading indicator while the joke is being fetched from the server : write a gradle task that starts the gce dev server runs all the android tests and shuts down the dev server

: : this is a sample application that shows how data binding can be used with lists : : it has a single list that can be updated by buttons at the top and bottom of the screen instead of being a recycler view the list is a linear layout containing items the binding adapter tracks the list and updates the views inside the view group this type of data binding is useful for view groups containing a small number of views that should be shown on the screen at the same time if you expect scrolling of your list you should use a recycler view instead the list binding adapters class contains the binding adapter that ties lists to view groups you can use this with any view group that needs only add view and remove view to manage child views such as linear layout the binding adapter works with both observable list and list depending on whether you need to track updates or not note that this is not a library rather a reference implementation you can should customize it for your app to get the best of it

gradle for android and java final project in this project you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and google cloud endpoints the finished app will consist of four modules a java library that provides jokes a google cloud endpoints gce project that serves those jokes an android library containing an activity for displaying jokes and an android app that fetches jokes from the gce module and passes them to the android library for display why this project as android projects grow in complexity it becomes necessary to customize the behavior of the gradle build tool allowing automation of repetitive tasks particularly factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity what will i learn? you will learn the role of gradle in building android apps and how to use gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity you'll learn to : : add free and paid flavors to an app and set up your build to share code between them : factor reusable functionality into a java library : factor reusable android functionality into an android library : configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app : use the gradle app engine plugin to deploy a backend : configure an integration test suite that runs against the local app engine development server how do i complete this project? step 0 : starting point this is the starting point for the final project which is provided to you in the course repository it contains an activity with a banner ad and a button that purports to tell a joke but actually just complains the banner ad was set up following the instructions here : you may need to download the google repository from the extras section of the android sdk manager when you can build an deploy this starter code to an emulator you're ready to move on step 1 : create a java library your first task is to create a java library that provides jokes create a new gradle java project either using the android studio wizard or by hand then introduce a project dependency between your app and the new java library if you need review check out demo 4 01 from the course code make the button display a toast showing a joke retrieved from your java joke telling library step 2 : create an android library create an android library containing an activity that will display a joke passed to it as an intent extra wire up project dependencies so that the button can now pass the joke from the java library to the android library for review on how to create an android library check out demo 4 03 for a refresher on intent extras check out; step 3 : create gce module this next task will be pretty tricky instead of pulling jokes directly from our java library we'll set up a google cloud endpoints development server and pull our jokes from there follow the instructions in the following tutorial to add a google could endpoints module to your project : introduce a project dependency between your java library and your gce module and modify the gce starter code to pull jokes from your java library create an async task to retrieve jokes make the button kick off a task to retrieve a joke then launch the activity from your android library to display it step 4 : add functional tests add code to test that your async task successfully retrieves a non empty string for a refresher on setting up android tests check out demo 4 09 step 5 : add a paid flavor add free and paid product flavors to your app remove the ad and any dependencies you can from the paid flavor optional tasks for extra practice to make your project stand out complete the following tasks add interstitial ad follow these instructions to add an interstitial ad to the free version display the ad after the user hits the button but before the joke is shown add loading indicator add a loading indicator that is shown while the joke is being retrieved and disappears when the joke is ready the following tutorial is a good place to start : configure test task to tie it all together create a gradle task that : 1 launches the gce local development server 2 runs all tests 3 shuts the server down again rubric required components : project contains a java library for supplying jokes : project contains an android library with an activity that displays jokes passed to it as intent extras : project contains a google cloud endpoints module that supplies jokes from the java library project loads jokes from gce module via an async task : project contains connected tests to verify that the async task is indeed loading jokes : project contains paidfree flavors the paid flavor has no ads and no unnecessary dependencies required behavior : app retrieves jokes from google cloud endpoints module and displays them via an activity from the android library optional components once you have a functioning project consider adding more features to test your gradle and android skills here are a few suggestions : : make the free app variant display interstitial ads between the main activity and the joke displaying activity : have the app display a loading indicator while the joke is being fetched from the server : write a gradle task that starts the gce dev server runs all the android tests and shuts down the dev server

everyday contents : download the app download the app : user documentation user documentation : developer documentation developer documentation : testing documentation testing documentation download the app clone or download this git repo open the project in android studio connect your android device to your computer and run the app user documentation making an account when you open everyday for the first time get started by logging into your google account creating an entry on the home page press the action button at the bottom right when the editor comes up simply fill in a title and write about whatever's on your mind if you want to discard changes go and don't save when you're satisfied with your entry save it by pressing the check mark action button at the bottom right the location and weather will be saved the content of your entry will also be analyzed by ibm's watson natural language processing api to assign you a sentiment score which measures how positive or negative the tone of your entry is adding a tag press the under the title to bring up a list of your tags select a tag that best fits your note to see how to customize your tags go to tags tags adding photos press the camera icon on the toolbar in the top left corner take as many pictures as you want to remember the moment you should see your photos show up on the page if it's your first time doing this the app will ask for permission to use the camera once you grant permission re navigate to the camera the app will remember this and won't ask for permission again deleting photos press and hold the photo you want to get rid of until you see a delete prompt select to delete if you delete a photo it cannot be undone photos you save on everyday are stored only on the app not on your phone's gallery adding audio press the mic icon on the toolbar in the top left corner a popup will prompt you to start recording select to begin recording and to stop you should now be able to playback your audio or record over it if it's your first time doing this the app will ask for permission once you grant permission re navigate to the audio recorder the app will remember this and won't ask for permission again deleting audio press and hold the audio playback until you see a delete prompt select to delete if you delete audio it cannot be undone audio you save on everyday is stored only on the app not on your phone tags select the button in the top right and select here you can see a list of your tags and how many entries you have associated with each one press on a tag to see a list of entries tagged with it editing tags click the button on a tag to change its name this will change the tag name of all entries tagged with this adding tags click the action button at the bottom right to add a new tag deleting tags click the to delete a tag this will remove the tag from all entries tagged with this atlas select the button in the top right and select here you can see your entries on a map analytics select the button in the top right and select here you can see your entries plotted over time based on their sentiment scores click a point on the plot to see the note it's associated with logging out select from the sidebar menu deleting your account select at the bottom of the sidebar menu developer documentation refer to our in code comments for detailed explanations below are some helpful starting points for functionality you might be interested in authentication see journal entries fields all fields in a journal entry are defined in list of entries calls which sets up a recycler view of s each journal entry preview is displayed with layout from addcreate a new entry when prompted to view an entry the app opens which creates this fragment handles all editing and previewing of title content images audio and asking permission for images and audio saving an entry this all takes place in when the save button is clicked is called which starts an async task that runs in the background this ensures that photos and audios can completely be uploaded to firebase storage and their ur ls saved before the journal entry is updated in all content is updated photos and audio are uploaded and saved and nlp analysis is done tags fields all fields in a journal entry are defined in list of tags opens which lists the tags using edit tags see and analytics gets journal entries from firebase and displays their sentiment scores on an xy plot atlas gets journal entries from firebase and displays them on a map using the google maps api testing documentation activity behavior testing each activity was systematically tested on its behavior when rotated interrupted or restarted the navigation between all activities was tested through the navigation drawer as well as through the action buttons on each activity page usability testing we ensured that all activities had a simple and appealing ui such that there would be no confusion on how to navigate through the app we accomplished this by have a navigation drawer available throughout each activity as well as an action icon on the bottom right of the screen authentication testing testing was done to make sure users can log in and log out show previous logged in accounts and stay logged in until they log out we also allow users to delete their account which deletes all the data stored for that user through the app permission testing everyday requires the following permissionssettings from the user : : location services on : location permissions : image capture permissions : audio record permissions the app prompts the user to make a choice as to whether they would like to accept or deny these permissions if that current user has not accepted permission before and the app behaves normally on both conditions multiple devices when a user is logged into multiple devices the default set up of the app is the same as if they were to only be logged into one device firebase testing we ensured that changing categories a shared attribute among journal entries changes the individual journal entry attribute values

: in this chapter were going to dig a little deeper into : : the activity lifecycle : : what happens when an activity is : : : created : : : and : : : destroyed : : : ? which methods get called when an activity is : made visible and appears in the foreground : and which get called when the activity : loses the focus and is hidden? : and : : how do you save and restore your activitys state : : ? : : apps you'll build : : : stopwatch img chapter 5 : the user interface lets face it you need to know how to create great layouts if youre building apps you want people to use you need to make sure they : : look just the way you want : : so far weve only scratched the surface when it comes to creating layouts so its time to look a : little deeper : well introduce you to more : : types of layout : : you can use and well also take you on a tour of the : : main gui components : : and how you use them by the end of the chapter youll see that even though they all look a little different all layouts and gui components have : : : more in common than you might think : : : img chapter 6 : list views and adapters want to know how to best structure your android app? youve learned some of the basic pieces that are user to build apps and now : its time to get organized : in this chapter well show you how you can take a bunch of ideas and : : : structure them to build an awesome app : : : well show you how : : lists of data : : can form the core part of your app design and how : : linking them together : : can create a : powerful and easy to use app : along the way you get your first glimpse of using : : event listeners : : and : : adapters : : to make your app more dynamic : : apps you'll build : : : starbuzz img chapter 7 : fragments youve seen how to create apps that work in the same way irrespective of the device theyre running on but what if you want your app to look and : behave differently : depending on whether its running on a : phone : or a : tablet : ? in this chapter well show you how to make your app choose the : : most appropriate layout for the device screen size : : well also introduce you to : : fragments : : a way of creating : modular code components : that can be : reused by different activities : : : apps you'll build : : : workout img chapter 8 : nested fragments youve seen how using fragments in activities allow you to reuse code and make your apps more flexible in this chapter were going to show you : how to nest one fragment inside another : youll see how to use the : : child fragment manager : : to tame unruly fragment transactions and along the way youll see why knowing the differences between activities and fragments is so important : : apps you'll build : : : workout updated img chapter 9 : action bars everybody likes a shortcut and in this chapter youll see how to add shortcuts to your apps using : : action bars : : well show you how to start other activities by : : adding action items : : to your action bar how to share content with other apps using the : : share action provider : : and how to navigate up your apps hierarchy by implementing : : the action bars up button : : along the way youll see how to give your app a consistant look and feel using : : themes : : and introduce you to the android support library package : : apps you'll build : : : bits and pizzas img chapter 10 : navigation drawers apps are so much better when theyre easy to navigate in this chapter were going to introduce you to the : : navigation drawer : : a slide out panel that appears when you swipe your finger or click an icon on the action bar well show you how to use it to display a : list of links : that take you to : : all the major hubs : : of your app youll also see how : switching fragments : makes those hubs : : easy to get to : : and : : fast to display : : : : apps you'll build : : : bits and pizzas updated img chapter 11 : sq lite databases if youre recording high scores or saving tweets your app will need to store data and on android you usually keep your data safe inside a : : sq lite database : : in this chapter well show you how to : create a database add tables to it : and : prepopulate it with data : all with the help of the friendly : : sq lite helper : : youll then see how you can cleanly roll out : upgrades : to your database structure and how to : downgrade : it if you need pull any changes : : apps you'll build : : : starbuzz updated img chapter 12 : cursors and async tasks so how do you connect your app to a sq lite database? so far youve seen how to create a sq lite database using a sq lite helper the next step is to get your activities to access it in this chapter youll find out how to use : : cursors : : to get data from the database how to : navigate : through cursors and how to : get data from them : youll then find out how to use : : cursor adapters : : to connect them to list views finally youll see how writing efficient : multi threaded : code with : : async tasks : : will keep your app speedy : : apps you'll build : : : starbuzz updated errr again img chapter 13 : services there are some operations you want to keep on running irrespective of which app has the focus as an example if you start playing a music file in a music app you probably expect it to keep on playing when you switch to another app in this chapter youll see how to use : : services : : to deal with situations just like this along the way youll see how use some of : : androids built in services : : youll see how to to keep your users informed with the : notification service : and how the : location service : can tell you where youre located : : apps you'll build : : : joke odometer img chapter 14 : material design with api level 21 google introduced material design in this chapter well look at : : what material design is : : and how to make your apps fit in with it well start by introducing you to : : card views : : you can reuse across your app for a : consistent look and feel : then well introduce you to the : : recycler view : : the list views flexible friend along the way youll see how to : : create your own adapters : : and how to completely change the look of a recycler view with : just two lines of code : : : apps you'll build : : : bits and pizzas one more time img appendix 1 : art&amp; x2013;the android runtime android apps need to run on devices with low powered processors and very little memory java apps can take up a lot of memory and because they run inside their own java virtual machine jvm java apps can take a long time to start when theyre running on low powered machines android deals with this by not using the jvm for its apps instead it uses a very different virtual machine called the android runtime art in this appendix well look at how art gets your java apps to run well on a small low powered device appendix 2 : adb&amp; x2013;the android debug bridge in this book weve focused on using an ide for all your android needs but there are times when using a command tool can be plain useful like those times when android studio cant see your android device but you just know its there in this chapter well introduce you to the android debug bridge or adb a command line tool you can use to communicate with the emulator or android devices appendix 3 : the android emulator ever felt like you were spending all your time waiting for the emulator? theres no doubt that using the android emulator is useful it allows you to see how your app will run on devices other than the physical ones you have access to but at times it can feel a little&amp; x2026; sluggish in this appendix were going to explain why the emulator can seem slow even better well give you a few tips weve learned for : : speeding it up : : appendix 4 : top ten things we didn't cover even after all that theres still a little more there are just a few more things we think you need to know we wouldnt feel right about ignoring them and we really wanted to give you a book youd be able to lift without extensive training at the local gym before you put down the book : : read through these tidbits : : get the book img head first android development cuts through the fog of dozens of components hundreds of api calls and focuses on the core skills you need do you want a book that is more than simply a reproduction of the online documentation? a book that is more like a course taking you step by step through the development of real applications just as if an experienced android developer was sitting right next to you? this book teaches android development by getting you to : do : android development for more information go to social media medium blog posts tweets by @head first droid

introduction this mission showcases a basic mapping of a business operation to a remote endpoint by taking this approach clients leverage the http protocol as a transport mechanism to call upon services application engineers define their ap is using a broad interpretation of rest fundamentals encouraging freedom in design and quick prototyping as an application or service matures this approach may not scale as desired to properly support clean api design or use cases involving database interactions any operations involving shared mutable state will have to be integrated with an appropriate backing datastore; all requests here will be scoped only to the container servicing the request and there is no guarantee that subsequent requests will be served by the same container this is recommended as an introduction to the mechanics of opening a service to be called upon by remote processes prerequisites to get started with this booster you'll need the following prerequisites : name description version

codesprint a project for google's applied cs course musical vehemence the app is basically a music player but with an additional feature the basic version of the application is an interface where the user can select a song play and pause it forward it etc the additional feature is that the user can play songs according to his mood the app recognises his mood by taking a picture of him on recognising the current state of his mind which we believe is very much evident on his face the application plays a song accordingly each emotion has a set of songs under it conversely each song is attributed to a particular facial expression the choice of which category the song belongs to is chosen by the user when he adds the song to his phone therefore the application will include a screen where the user gets to select a song manually this screen also contains a button that on being clicked redirects the user to the camera application where the user can capture his picture once hes done the application processes the picture recognises his expression extracts the particular song from the database and plays it we believe that on completion we will have before us an exciting app with a beautiful user interface and wonderful features

introduction this mission showcases a basic mapping of a business operation to a remote endpoint by taking this approach clients leverage the http protocol as a transport mechanism to call upon services application engineers define their ap is using a broad interpretation of rest fundamentals encouraging freedom in design and quick prototyping as an application or service matures this approach may not scale as desired to properly support clean api design or use cases involving database interactions any operations involving shared mutable state will have to be integrated with an appropriate backing datastore; all requests here will be scoped only to the container servicing the request and there is no guarantee that subsequent requests will be served by the same container this is recommended as an introduction to the mechanics of opening a service to be called upon by remote processes prerequisites to get started with this booster you'll need the following prerequisites : name description version

momomo build status overview momomo is an application used for tracking competencies of employees of an organization competencies are associated with specific learning materials and as users go through their learning materials they gain competencies in certain areas certain competencies also have sub competencies which means that a user is not able to learn a skill before learning other prerequisite skills if an employee is an assessor they are able to query what competencies a given employee has they are also able to check the prerequisite tree for a given competency and check which employees have a given competency sprint 1 for sprint 1 we are going to build a simple user interface that allows a user to add employees and view all employees in a list this will interact with the model components that we made for this sprint and use the repositories for storing and retrieving data from the persistence database we are also making it so there are multiple different types of learning materials such as books conferences and courses sprint 2 for sprint 2 we will be expanding on the skills functionality when a user learns from a learning material i e a learning materials is added to a user they will also learn the skills associated with that learning material there will also be windows to review what skills an employee has and which learning materials they have learned from there will also be a login page and different priveleges associated with each of the user roles a basic user can inspect users an assessor can assign learning materials and skills and an admininistrator can create and remove users sprint 3 for sprint 3 we will be expanding on the sub skill features skills will be able to have sub skills and prerequisites if a learning material is applied to a user with a skill that is a sub skill of a skill not yet learned by that user an error is thrown and the user cannot learn without the prerequisite knowledge we will also be refactoring the gui to add css styling to improve the user experience the final touches will be added to allow for a more stable release with more unit tests and status popups heroku app link

calculator a material design calculator with cards about card calculator was created with the idea of giving calculators in android a more unique perspective and utilizing material design to allow quicker and more intuitive navigation over a long series of events the current standard for calculators in the android ecosystem is exactly what one would normally expect : a grid of buttons while google's official calculator app does use a swipe gesture to allow more screen space to be saved i thought that there was still more possibility for improvement thus this app was created for input it uses the standard keyboard used on the android device this means that the user will already be accustomed to its layout and won't need time to get used to entering info in the app it also provides some extra features that could be useful and wouldn't be easy to implement otherwise such as the voice input option on google keyboard after inputting an equation it will be parsed using the exp4j library i did have my own algorithm to parse the equation for a while but over the course of time i was trying to add new features it became ridiculously hard to test and debug so i eventually gave up and switched to a library i met someone on a forum while trying to debug it that helpfully pointed me to this recently solved equations show in a list on the app's main page clicking on them allows you to copy the equation to the clipboard or edit it while swiping deletes it and shows a snackbar with an option to undo the action this kind of behavior is standard for many apps in android so it should be relatively easy for a new user to figure out the interface of the app and start using it the app's icon was designed by vukain anelkovi license

sonar qube test data importer plugin simple plugin to import unit test reports and coverate supports xunit gtest and nunit for tests metrics and a json format for coverage features 1 unit test metrics 2 coverage metrics motivation i needed to create branchcondition coverage in sonar in a way that merged reports are actually making sence currently 6 3 saving coverage measures is done like this with this we are unable to specific what coditionbranches have been covered for example many coverage tools provide this information like opencover so when using existing coverage imports or codition coverage is not counted at all as in c plugin or all they allow you to feed multiple reports and then the behaviour is not deterministic maybe this situation will change in future however for now it seems sonar qube folks give the responsibility to handle this behaviour to users so when using generic coverate in 6 3 you must ensure all data is first merged into one single file if you use more than one it does not work for that reason this plugin introduces a new coverage format were you can specify branch ids with this all data is initially parsed and cached and merged together and then used per module when files have been found this method supports opencover really well and at this moment this is the only way to collect branchcondition coverage for it you need to use the open cover converter application to create the coverage json but after this all should be cleanly displayed in sonar quickstart 1 setup a sonar qube instance 2 install the plugin 3 sonar tests coverage report path for coverage report example : coverage json sonar tests unit report path for unit test report example : test xml sonar tests unit xunit xslt url for unit test report transformation

ambrosia : : background : : according to health line 1 in every 4 college students suffer from mental illness 44% of college students report having symptoms of depression and 75% of college students do not seek help for their mental health problems mental health problems such as depression are a rampant issue that affects many individuals in my case i personally know that three of my friends are suffering from depression they sometimes talk about how they cut themselves to relieve stress and honestly i am thankful that my friends believe in me enough to confide in me their problems however i'm worried about the others that keep it inside they refuse to visit the campus counseling and psychological services because of the societal stigma associated with mental illnesses they refuse to tell their friends because they don't want to seem weak in front of others and are afraid of being judged as a result our team decided to create a hack to help out our fellow students suffering from mental health issues project functionality our project is a simple android app that involves talking to an ai the user is able to talk to a unbiased ai about their problems without fear of being judged by their peers their inputs are analyzed through watson's natural language understanding api and we will refer them to psychiatrists in severe cases the ai is specially geared towards listening to the user and encouraging them to talk about themselves and their problems it tracks what the user says and tries to tell if the user has any mental issues that may need diagnosing in those cases it refers the user to nearby doctors it can also detect emergencies and respond appropriately conclusion although we tried as much as possible to make the app human like and realistic it was a difficult task and still needs work if we had more time we would have implemented machine learning to have ambrosia improve her ability to communicate with the user as if she learned through neural networks this would have made ambrosia much easier to communicate with overall we are still proud in the progress we made in natural language processing ai communication and in our potential ability to assist in the mental health status of many affected individuals

detecting duplicate files in a given path in this homework you will recursively traverse all the regular files in a given path you can do so with the simple file visitor interface you can start with the walking the file tree example and iterate on it instead of comparing two files byte by byte you will compare their checksum values you will calculate a checksum for each file using an algorithm of your choice i used cyclic redundancy check https : en wikipedia orgwiki cyclic_redundancy_check but feel free to choose another one if computed checksum values are equal then we can assume that files are duplicates of each other use an appropriate data structure to group files under the same checksum : : hint : : : your program will sort the duplicate lists by the number of files in each list for example if four duplicates of a file is detected then this four files will be printed before a duplicate list of size two the starter code contains a helper method which can either inspire you or be used as is you can easily test your program by downloading a solr 6 4 1 http : www eu apache orgdistlucenesolr6 4 1solr 6 4 1 tgz distribution extract it into some location and use this path as starting directory of your program : java jar target hw1 1 0 jar usersiorixxx desktopsolr 6 4 1 and the program will print out something like :

firebase fcm token synchronization the project aims at synchronizing the fcm token used for push notifications with an app server approach the token is refreshed in one of the following cases : the app deletes instance id the app is restored on a new device the user uninstallsreinstall the app the user clears app data the method is invoked whenever anyone of the above situation arises so we can get the new token by calling and starting a synchronization routine to update the token in the app server since there is no app server firebase realtime database was used instead to store the token in case the user is not connected to internet and the token needs to be refreshed then the app will not generate a new token unless a connection is established once the connection is active the synchronization is done automatically

spark example this is a simple example program to use apache spark that i followed this tutorial steps to run : 1 mvn clean install 2 java jar targetspark example 1 0 snapshot jar input txt summary : data analysis with spark the steps for analyzing data with spark can be grossly summarized as follows : 1 obtain a reference to an rdd 2 perform transformations to convert the rdd to the form you want to analyze 3 execute actions to derive your result set an important note is that while you may specify transformations they do not actually get executed until you specify an action this allows spark to optimize transformations and reduce the amount of redundant work that it needs to do another important thing to note is that once an action is executed you'll need to apply the transformations again in order to execute more actions if you know that you're going to execute multiple actions then you can persist the rdd before executing the first action by invoking the persist method; just be sure to release it by invoking unpersist when you're done spark in a distributed environment : figure 1 https : i imgsafe org9283875946 jpeg spark consists of two main components : 1 spark driver the spark driver is the process that contains your main method and defines what the spark application should do this includes creating rd ds transforming rd ds and applying actions under the hood when the spark driver runs it performs two key activities : a converts your program into tasks : your application will contain zero or more transformations and actions so it's the spark driver's responsibility to convert those into executable tasks that can be distributed across the cluster to executors additionally the spark driver optimizes your transformations into a pipeline to reduce the number of actual transformations needed and builds an execution plan it is that execution plan that defines how tasks will be executed and the tasks themselves are bundled up and sent to executors b schedules tasks for executors : from the execution plan the spark driver coordinates the scheduling of each task execution as executors start they register themselves with the spark driver which gives the driver insight into all available executors because tasks execute against data the spark driver will find the executors running on the machines with the correct data send the tasks to execute and receive the results 2 executors spark executors are processes running on distributed machines that execute spark tasks executors start when the application starts and typically run for the duration of the application they provide two key roles : a execute tasks sent to them by the driver and return the results b maintain memory storage for hosting and caching rd ds the cluster manager is the glue that wires together drivers and executors spark provides support for different cluster managers including hadoop yarn and apache mesos the cluster manager is the component that deploys and launches executors when the driver starts you configure the cluster manager in your spark context configuration

join the chat at image j2 is a new version of image j seeking to strengthen both the software and its community internally it is a total redesign of image j but it is backwards compatible with image j 1 x via a legacy layer and features a user interface closely modeled after the original under the hood image j2 completely isolates the image processing logic from the graphical user interface ui allowing image j2 commands to be used in many contexts including headless in the cloud or on a server such as omero or from within another application such as knime icy or cell profiler a python application image j2 has an n dimensional data model driven by the powerful img lib2 library which supports image data expressed in an extensible set of numeric and non numeric types and accessed from an extensible set of data sources image j2 is driven by a state of the art collaborative development process including version control unit testing automated builds via a continuous integration system a bug tracker and more we are collaborating closely with related projects including fiji scifio and ome and are striving to deliver a coherent software stack reusable throughout the life sciences community and beyond for more details see the sci java web site image j2 is currently in the beta stage meaning the code is not finished it is being released for early community feedback and testing comments questions and bug reports are much appreciated to maintain image j's continuity of development we have modeled the application after image j v1 x as much as is reasonable however please be aware that image j2 is essentially a total rewrite of image j from the ground up it provides backward compatibility with older versions of image j by bundling the latest v1 x code and translating between legacy and modern image structures for more details on the project see the image j web site licensing

technical design : major classes split is into four packages for input and output api for the data storage with in memory implementation could be used h2 or fongo in memory db but as limitation for the dependencies i have decided for using maps and lists as data storage for the communication and processing data following standard pattern for the rest microservices but it should be same for message driven approach as well as it abstracting consuming messages from their receiving other packages are support classes for data holders and exception definitions three message approach as per the specification there are three types of messages and in the solution they're represented via the single sale message interface with default methods for optional attributes sale service based on the attribute values decides what operation type is required this approach allows either rest or messaging oriented implementation in the real scenario following standard patterns reporting reporting is delegated to the report service handling all type of reports at the moment writing all into the file to the path provided from the configuration file database or different file format might appropriate for the production adjustments processing in the assignment there is no definition how to behave in the situations when adjustment is for a product what has not been processing yet so the service is just adding this message to the list and it's marked as processed depends on the needs in could keep that message as long as a message with defined product would be processed or should return an error when an unknown product both solutions would bring up questions for further specification like should i keep information for all new messages of the same product? similar to operation what would take price below zero in my scenario it's allowed and it would mean returned product but again real implementation would depend on the system needs compiling and testing the project is using maven 3 3 x version with java 8 the code itself is tested on above 90% coverage in average running command mvn clean install will compile the code and run these unit tests code quality to ensure high standard of the code it has included pmd and findbugs static code checkers you can run then mvn clean install pmd : pmd findbugs : findbugs

nwea war jesse l mull v0 0 1 snapshot introduction this small application simulates a game of war using an arbitrary number of suits ranks and players the application is built using maven and tests are run using j unit 4 please note that i added additional methods to the deck interface provided by nwea installation the build process will compile all java classes output a four player example game using a standard french deck and run all tests example output is also available in the example output txt file : : to build print output and run tests : : : mvn clean install : : to build and omit outputtests : : : mvn clean dskip tests install documentation javadoc is located in the doc directory testing the unit tests for the card and deck implementations are straight forward the war class contains a number of private methods i chose to set the methods accessible using reflection i recognize that this may produce undesirable results for testing if any private methods are changed an alternative is make the methods public or rely only on the public methods for unit testing i chose to test the private methods as i built the program so i could split it up into manageable chunks rules 1 the deck of cards is shuffled and players are dealt one card at a time from the top of the deck until no cards remain 2 each player draws a card face up from the top of their deck 3 cards are compared by rank only the player that draws the card with the highest rank collects the drawn cards shuffles them and adds them to the bottom of their deck shuffling the cards randomly prevents an infinite loop 4 if two or more cards share the highest rank a war occurs all players participate in the war 5 in the event of a war each player draws three more cards face down and one card face up 6 the player that draws the face up card with the highest rank wins all the drawn cards in the event of another tie wars continue to execute until there is a winner 7 during a war if a player runs out of cards they draw their last card face up this card is used as the face up card for the current war and any other additional wars 8 a player loses when they run out of cards 9 the game ends when a single player is left or a tie occurs if a single player remains the remaining player is the winner 10 a tie occurs when all remaining players possess cards with the same rank in the same order with a large number of players this occurs fairly frequently when all remaining players are down to one card during a war card class &amp; interface the card class and interface define the behavior of a standard playing card a card contains both a suit and rank initialized during construction the rank and suit can be retrieved with standard get methods the card class also implements a comparable method cards are compared by rank alone in a game of war the to string method prints the rank and suit in the format rank suit deck class &amp; interface the deck class and interface define the behavior of a standard deck of cards the deck constructor takes a name as a parameter the deck name is used to identify each player that participates in a game of war which is useful for game output the create method adds all possible card permutations using the provided number of suits and ranks cards in a deck are stored within an array list the top card resides at index zero while the bottom card resides in the last list index the peek function allows the user to examine the top card in the deck without removing it the deal method removes and returns the top card in the deck the deck also contains getters for the number of cards deck name and card list the is empty method returns true if the deck is empty the shuffle method uses collections shuffle to randomize the cards a single card or a list of cards can be added to the bottom of the deck war class the war class possesses two public methods the first toggles a boolean value that indicates whether or not each hand is output to the console the play method executes a war game using an arbitrary number of suits ranks and players there are a number of methods that help print output to the console the basic execution of the game is as follows : 1 cards are dealt to each player each player is represented as a deck of cards 2 a while loop continues to execute until a winner is declared each cycle players draw a card from the top of their decks 3 the winners are determined by peeking at the top card for each deck 4 if no tie occurs the cards for the hand are removed from each deck shuffled and then added to the bottom of the winner's deck 5 all empty decks are removed from the list of player decks and the list of player decks is checked to see if there is a single winner remaining or if all remaining players possess cards with the same rank in the same order if a win or tie occurs the program returns and prints the winner or winners 6 in the event of a war the war method is executed the decks are passed to the war function before any cards are remove from the deck and added to the winnings this is necessary in case a player has only one card remaining this card will be used as the face up card for all subsequent wars 7 before players draw cards for war the check for tie method is invoked this ensures that an infinite war loop does not occur the infinite loop can occur if two or more players have only one card with the highest rank 8 each deck contributes their drawn card and three face down cards to the winnings the top card for each deck is then checked for the card with the highest rank if there is no tie all the winnings are added to the winning deck 9 in the case of another tie the war loop continues until there is a winner 10 when the war function returns losers are removed from the player list and the list of players is checked again to determine if a winner exists

swerve robotics ftc library : note : new use of the swerve robotics library is not recommended as nearly all the functionality provided therein has been folded into the core ftc sdk for those returning here from last year welcome : welcome to the swerve robotics library for the ftc robot controller runtime the original purpose of our library was to augment the robot controller runtime library from ftc hq in order to simplify programming for ftc teams over the course of the 2015 16 season we implemented a considerable amount of functionality that aided in that endeavor however during that season and through the subsequent summer virtually all of that functionality was incorporated into the core ftc sdk as of this writing 5 sept 2016 the only tiny remaining pieces are the gated gamepad updates and a very small enhancement to color sensors which are likely no longer needed accordingly for the time being at least the swerve robotics library is being mothballed thank you for your support and feedback it was much appreciated archive the remainder of this readme is of historical interest only the central aim here is not to change what's there just to make it better the library is a drop in replacement : if your code works with the ftc hq release it will work with the swerve library but you can also take advantage of new things : : please : : consult the git hub release notes for details regarding a given release you might also want to check out our related project the swerve robotics tools suite also here on git hub notable features of the swerve robotics ftc library include the following note : the 'easy' controllers are now part of the core sdk the functionality is as described here but they are now : always : in use irrespective of the flavor of opmode easy legacy motor controller : : easy legacy motor controller : : is a replacement for the stock dc motor controller implementation used with legacy hi technic motor controllers easy legacy motor controller does away with the need to manually switch motors from read mode to write mode and back again and the attendant complex delay management loop counting or waiting for hardware cycles that that requires just call or whatever other motor methods you need to use and the right things happen under the covers easy modern motor &amp; servo controller and easy legacy servo controller in a conceptually similar way alternate implementations for modern motor and servo controllers and for legacy servo controllers is also provided the api simplifications for these controllers are less dramatic than for the easy legacy motor controller but are worthwhile nevertheless most importantly reads and writes to these device now happen virtually when you issue them and reads or writes that follow a write are sequenced after that write so as to preserve causality this simplifies programming change a motor mode? fine it's changed : anything else you do on that motor will be sure to have seen the effect of that change you don't have to poll to see whether the mode change has taken effect reset the encoders and then immediately change to run with encoders? perfectly fine it just works additionally a handful of bug fixes is included for example is now functionally useful

cs321 android group app iris morning assistant iris is a morning assistant that simplifies your day : everything from your alarm calendar events and the weather are easily accessible in one easy to use interface no more looking through several apps to obtain the desired information once you turn off your morning alarm iris presents you this information about the upcoming day functional requirements provide a prioritized and approximately estimated list of functional requirements for the system describe each requirement briefly and state the rationale for including that requirement also describe the prioritization and estimation schemes used task : alarm clock setting and ability to turn off user needs to be able to set an alarm with the option to repeat on specific days the app needs to activate after the alarm is turned off this requirement is at the top as it is needed for the app to start it is also one of the features needed for our minimum viable product task : calendar display next event in order of priority display all events for the day from your google calendar this requirement is second on our priority list since this information will be what the user will be most concerned about relating to their day task : gather weather app info display information for today in the weather widget displays expanded information after the widget has been pressed this requirement is near the top as it is also apart of our core desired information extra : task : implement text to speech read out the selected information to the user this requirement is lower in our list because we want to focus on compiling the information in one place first before adding this extra feature task : to do list display any items you have marked at to do by the end of the day or reminders you have set similar to implementing the google calendar we will add the option to implement reminders from google keep since google keep and google calendar already work well together this requirement is second on our extras list because once we have text to speech working the next most important information a user would desire would be items the person already wants to be reminded about task : random compliment tip : deliver a tip or complement to the user at the conclusion of the daily digest this is our lowest priority requirement since this information doesnt actually relate to the users day however it would be fairly simple to implement once text to speech is set up list of non functional requirements identify the non functional requirements for the system record any constraints that these requirements may place on the system to be built interoperability : iris is capable of using information stored in other apps combine it and present it to the user in an effective manner thus making it interoperable information should be gathered without causing a noticeable delay from the user perspective accessibility : iris is readily available to use as soon as you wake up it doesnt require multiple steps to be able to use it just turning the alarm off activates the app all main features should be no more than two taps away from the main screen efficiency : iris efficiently presents the information in orderly manner based on users priority less than 1+0 25 : of tasksevents minutes reliability : iris is reliable in the sense that the information doesnt change when the data is merged from various apps also the alarm clock works accurately data should only change when specified by the user the app should perform the intended functions when required

this code was created for purposes for evaluation of my android code skills instructions lets say say you have instances of class comment that need to get saved somehow via a remote store of some type 1 please provide draft code pseudocode or a clear description that indicates how you would save these comment objects to a remote store is such a fashion as to allow : a the remote store to be changed at some unknown point in the future for example from parse to a res tful server minimizing impact on the android code particularly avoiding direct changes to the comment class itself dont worry about the api interface to the datastore unless that is key to your solution b the design pattern s adopted and implemented for comment to be leveraged minimizing code duplication to allow other objects e g a new class called annotation to be saved similarly key to our interest in this problem are the android design patterns and language features that you would use to accomplish these two goals efficiently and cleanly maximizing object oriented reusability and flexibility while avoiding over designed code 2 make any assumptions you would like just make sure that you clearly state those assumptions for example dont worry about the low level details like networking code or asynchrony focus instead on the patterns that allow a and b to be accomplished first impression : since we have a collections of comments and annotations as well as other future types not foreseen the method for storage should handle multiple object types because of conversion times to amorphous strings and possible upload time saving data should be done off the main ui thread there are four general approaches to perform saving outside the activity ui thread they are : one simply instantiate a runnable inside a thread class instance; two use async task or volley owned by the activity with the ui that receives the user intention of saving; or three use a private service; or four use a content provider to handle saving and retrieval the first approach could work but since this is a fairly generic task this may be making us do more work than needed and if the activity goes away will loose the data the second approach would be the least work but it has one drawback if the user closes the app or the activity hosting volley or async task will terminate resulting in termination of the saving task the third is to use a 'intent service' which runs in a separate thread and will continue even it the activity stops or is destroyed by the os the fourth approach is overkill unless its known that other apps will need to save similar or identical objects comments annotations or derived object of either i have chosen to use an intent service with the comments and annotations saved to a model singleton note the intent service run on their own worker thread off the main thread we will use local broad manager to broadcast message and receivers for service to activity communication the somewhat ambiguous part of the test is what assumptions can be made about the comment or annotation instances : are they serializable are they pojo annotated objects also what kinds of structure do we assume the remote data store have is it a relational database with a table with columns to store attribute of the objects were storing for purposes of this assignment well assume that the client doesnt need to know how the server deserializes the submitted objects are of no concern to the client android app and that we want to create a loose coupling between the data objects and the views and controllers for this test ill simply assume remote storage can accept a json string in all cases to make the client independent of changes to comment or annotation we will make use of interfaces for each kind of object that we might want to store we will have a helper class all of which will implement a common interface specifying methods to support serializing and deserializing the object we wont assume the data classes themselves support this directly or the interface the helper classes implements this app will compile install and launch but it isn't actually functional since no backend is connected and the view does not support creation or rendering of comments or annotations the code here simply demonstrates how the spec can be implemented to make this fully functional would require more than the couple hours expected to be used for this assignment late additions include utilization of deserializing library fasterxml google analytics for android and dagger2 for dependency injection ron alt text screenshot png?raw true see screenshot : screenshot png

seleniumtestng test design workflow generally speaking in order to create a new test you will have to perform all or some of the following actions : create page and component classes representing gui you are testing you will have to do that only if those classes don't exist yet add necessary accessor and action methods to existing page and component classes again you will need to do it only if they are missing from those classes write your test s using page and component classes at the early stages we will have to do a lot of 1 and 2 but as our framework code base grows we will have to do less and less of it and concentrate mainly on the writing new tests test design considerations general the main requirement for our tests is resilience tests shall not break due to changes not related to tested functionality this is so important that we may decide that certain aspects of functionality will have to be tested manually simply because we don't know how to create stable enough automated tests for them to achieve test resiliency we shall follow the following rules : each test shall be short and focused there shall be minimal preparations for testing we shall limit usage of screenshots for test verification and instead verify corresponding dom elements if possible screenshot shall be mainly used to verify static gui like display of certain document or grid or dialog when using screenshots we shall minimize their size as much as possible test packages classes all test classes shall be organized by functionality it doesn't matter whether specific tests in this class are used for acceptance regression or something else this shall be sorted out inside test suite xml having tests organized by functionality allows s es and q es relatively easy find tests that need to be run for a certain code change there can be some exceptions to this rule for example tests specifically designed for load testing can be stored in separate packages or even in separate projects framework source code structure srcmainjava desktop automation framework source code com microstrategy selenium2 page html5vi html5 vi page based on the extended classes of ilias web automation framework com microstrategy selenium2 page html5vi ui ui components com microstrategy selenium2 page html5vi action wrappers for feature actions com microstrategy selenium2 page html5vi common contains common utility classes such as keyboard mouse actions xpath syntax library common ui elements as context menu etc com microstrategy selenium2 page desktop connectivity desktop connectivity feature srctestjava test ng test scripts based on desktop automation framework

jakatomelodia i didn't translate the name of this app because that is a name of a tv show from poland on this show participants have to guess songs titles and that is why my app does too in fact it's rather a game i've done my best to make this app as professional as it gets however i have many plans for improving it in the future there's a lot to be done but before going into details here's the video of my app turn the sound on sorry for reccording with another phone but using software my video is scattered and unwatchable : so as you can see when you tap new game you have 10 songs to guess there is an array of songs the app can choose if you've guessed correct you get 10 points if not you get no points if you wat too long and song is over you get no points you can cancel your game at any time by tapping x icon you can exit app by tapping exit button here are some screenshots from my app : main_screen correct score alert

gradle for android and java final project in this project you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and google cloud endpoints the finished app will consist of four modules a java library that provides jokes a google cloud endpoints gce project that serves those jokes an android library containing an activity for displaying jokes and an android app that fetches jokes from the gce module and passes them to the android library for display why this project as android projects grow in complexity it becomes necessary to customize the behavior of the gradle build tool allowing automation of repetitive tasks particularly factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity what will i learn? you will learn the role of gradle in building android apps and how to use gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity you'll learn to : : add free and paid flavors to an app and set up your build to share code between them : factor reusable functionality into a java library : factor reusable android functionality into an android library : configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app : use the gradle app engine plugin to deploy a backend : configure an integration test suite that runs against the local app engine development server how do i complete this project? step 0 : starting point this is the starting point for the final project which is provided to you in the course repository it contains an activity with a banner ad and a button that purports to tell a joke but actually just complains the banner ad was set up following the instructions here : you may need to download the google repository from the extras section of the android sdk manager when you can build an deploy this starter code to an emulator you're ready to move on step 1 : create a java library your first task is to create a java library that provides jokes create a new gradle java project either using the android studio wizard or by hand then introduce a project dependency between your app and the new java library if you need review check out demo 4 01 from the course code make the button display a toast showing a joke retrieved from your java joke telling library step 2 : create an android library create an android library containing an activity that will display a joke passed to it as an intent extra wire up project dependencies so that the button can now pass the joke from the java library to the android library for review on how to create an android library check out demo 4 03 for a refresher on intent extras check out; step 3 : create gce module this next task will be pretty tricky instead of pulling jokes directly from our java library we'll set up a google cloud endpoints development server and pull our jokes from there follow the instructions in the following tutorial to add a google could endpoints module to your project : introduce a project dependency between your java library and your gce module and modify the gce starter code to pull jokes from your java library create an async task to retrieve jokes make the button kick off a task to retrieve a joke then launch the activity from your android library to display it step 4 : add functional tests add code to test that your async task successfully retrieves a non empty string for a refresher on setting up android tests check out demo 4 09 step 5 : add a paid flavor add free and paid product flavors to your app remove the ad and any dependencies you can from the paid flavor optional tasks for extra practice to make your project stand out complete the following tasks add interstitial ad follow these instructions to add an interstitial ad to the free version display the ad after the user hits the button but before the joke is shown add loading indicator add a loading indicator that is shown while the joke is being retrieved and disappears when the joke is ready the following tutorial is a good place to start : configure test task to tie it all together create a gradle task that : 1 launches the gce local development server 2 runs all tests 3 shuts the server down again rubric required components : project contains a java library for supplying jokes : project contains an android library with an activity that displays jokes passed to it as intent extras : project contains a google cloud endpoints module that supplies jokes from the java library project loads jokes from gce module via an async task : project contains connected tests to verify that the async task is indeed loading jokes : project contains paidfree flavors the paid flavor has no ads and no unnecessary dependencies required behavior : app retrieves jokes from google cloud endpoints module and displays them via an activity from the android library optional components once you have a functioning project consider adding more features to test your gradle and android skills here are a few suggestions : : make the free app variant display interstitial ads between the main activity and the joke displaying activity : have the app display a loading indicator while the joke is being fetched from the server : write a gradle task that starts the gce dev server runs all the android tests and shuts down the dev server

use at your own risk vera scene controller for wink relay requires root and changing of permissions for key files the address of the controller is hard coded into the program and needs to be personalized this program is a bit of a frankenstein and was created from bits and pieces of information and code off the web it is being published not as an example of a good program but to help document aome of the wink relay features and how they can be used for other uses the following pages helped me understand some of the concepts and much of the code was cut and pasted from their work important to add that since i really don't know what i am doing i am sure this program could be re written much more elegantly and nothing i have done reflects on their skills or work as it has been appropriated for this project this page provided the insight to the gpio interrupts needed to activate the two buttons on the relay important to note that the edge of the gpios is set to none so a script is needed to set them to rising falling or both depending on requirements gpio7 bottom button gpio8 top button gpio30 turns the screen on and off not used in this program gpio203 and 204 switch relays not used in this program at one point this program also controlled truning the screen on and off but the function was removed and moved to a stand alone program for reference the way it was achieved was listening to the screen input file devinputevent0 screen input file sysbusi2cdevices2 005ainputinput3ps_input_data proximity sensor this was the reference for adding the weather portion to the program to use this feature you will need an open weather key the key and city are stored in the strings file instead of using the weather font started to impliment changing the screen background image as an indicator but this is incomplete used to understand alarms for refreshing the weather not part of the program but useful information on adding soft keys to the relay again not part of the program but what was used to root the relay use at your own risk

this is an addon to the app dynamics machine agent the extension uses the app dynamics rest api to collect events for each application in the specified controller it compares open vs closed events to determine if the application has normal warning or critical status; and then it writes one custom metric status per application : if normal 0; if warning 1; if critical 2 by default the extension will be invoked every 2 minutes you can create health rules for the status of an application then use health status or health list widget to show application status in a dashboard you can also use if any of the following conditions are met to show the worst status for a group of applications historical metrics for application status will be available but average values will be invalid if the extension runs every 2 or more minutes the maximum value for a time period is the best metric to use when showing historical status

project 1 stage one quiz master was created by fangge deng and harrison lundberg quiz master begins by launching the main activity which presents the user with a list of available quizzes to be played after clicking on one of these options game activity is started and the selected quiz is begun the user answers one question at a time by clicking on the correct answer out of a list of possible answers to the question while playing the quiz the current score and number of remaining questions is kept up to date upon completing all of the questions the user is taken to final activity which tells the final score the user got and presents the user with the option to return to the main menu while playing a quiz the user can quit the app the current state is saved in shared preferences so that when the user restarts the app and goes to the main menu there is now a continue button which allows to the user to continue the previously started quiz from wherever they left off goals that have been achieved : we first completed all of the required criteria for stage 1 : our app supports both the xml format given in class as well as our custom json quiz format using the json quiz parser and xml quiz parser classes the local quizzes are stored in the assetsquizzes directory our app correctly saves the user's progress in the current quiz across killing the app and restarting the phone by using shared preferences our app also supports quizzes with different kinds of answers by using the answer class and the answers adapter the images for answers are stored locally in the drawable directory our app supports questions with a variable number of answers by using a list view additionally : our app can access quizzes stored remotely by allowing the user to enter a url of a quiz this quiz is then fetched by volley and is added to the available list of quizzes furthermore we used glide to support fetching images from urls we have created three json quizzes stored on the internet and they can be found at the following urls : our main menu now allows the user to first select the genre of quiz they wish to play rather than simply listing out all of the available quizzes explanation of warnings in android studio's code analysis : hardcoded string currently we have our strings hardcoded into the layout xml files but in the future we could change this to a string resource so that we could easily swap out the strings to another language implicitly using the default locale we were told in class that we did not have to worry about using the default locale at the moment missing commit on shared preference editor this message is recommending that we use apply rather than commit when writing changes to shared preferences field can be local there are three instance variables which could currently be converted to local variables because they are each only used in one method however we anticipate writing new methods in the future which will also need these values so we decide to leave them as instance variables unchecked call to there are currently two calls to adapter methods which the compiler says are unchecked however these do not affect the correctness of our application access can be package local we receive this error on our two classes question and quiz generator this means that we could change the visibility of these classes to package local instead of public to increase encapsulation because no class outside of our package is currently using these two classes however it is possible that in the future we may want to reuse our question and quiz generator classes outside of the quiz master app therefore we have decided to keep these two classes public declaration can have final modifier we receive these warnings in the question class where we could declare the question statement and answers as final because at this point they are never changed once initialized however we cannot at this time rule out the possibility of dynamically changing one or more of these values at runtime therefore we leave out the final modifier this error also appears in quiz generator where we could make the list of questions final but in the future we may want to include the ability to dynamically add questions to a given quiz so we exclude the final modifier unused method parameters these warnings are present in all of our activity classes with the on button click methods the reason is that we never actually use the view parameter which is passed in however android requires that the signatures of these methods include the view parameter r mipmap ic_launcher not used this error appears because we created our own icon which means we no longer use the default image however we did not want to delete the default one just in case we need it in the future buttons in button bars should be borderless we at first followed android studio's suggestion of removing the borders from the buttons however it changed the appearance of our app and we preferred the original look therefore we decided to keep the borders on the buttons in addition there are some warnings in the code analysis that seemed out of our control at this point in time these warnings include consider adding the attribute 'android : full backup content' to specify an @xml resource which configures which files to back up missing support for firebase app indexing a missing return statement in the build gradle file and an unused property in the gradle properties file finally we receive some spelling warnings but these are all warnings about text in our comments where we use words such as quizmaster which isn't technically a word

problem statement : indian government wants you to create a java solution for managing the voting on motions once debate has concluded in the parliament the system you create must accept votes for or against on a specified motion and determine whether motion is pass or fail conditions : 1 no votes can be accepted upon a motion until it is opened for voting 2 when a motion is closed for voting, a result is returned that describes whether the motion passed or failed the number of votes for and against the time that voting opened and closed 3 a motion cannot be closed for voting less than 15 minutes after it was opened 4 no voter can vote more than once on the same motion 5 the maximum votes that can be received on a motion is 51 6 if voting is a tie, then an attempt to close the motion for voting will cause it to enter a special &quot;tied&quot; state 7 in the &quot;tied&quot; state, the speaker of the parliament is the only person allowed to vote once the speaker votes, the motion is automatically closed 8 the speaker is not allowed to vote except when voting has entered the &quot;tied&quot; state 9 if the speaker is not available to vote, then voting can be forced to the closed state which causes the motion to fail implementation details : 1 expose a rest api to start a new motion only speaker should have access to start a new motion 2 expose a rest api to accept vote of a user for or against 2 expose a rest api to get the current state of a motion at any time not started, in progress, completed, tied, void 3 expose a rest api to get the results of a motion the number of votes for and against, and the time that voting opened and closed 4 write unit test cases to validate the above conditions note : the solution will be evaluated on following parameters object oriented design aspects of the solution overall coding practices working code covering the above conditions you must include a brief explanation of your design, restrictions and assumptions in a readme file

bulletin project summary the various extracurricular that college has to offer are an integral part of college life however given the wide variety of extracurricular and the innumerable competitions existing it becomes a hassle for a student to register for various events since there is no common portal for all registrations to take place under one roof often deadlines to register are missed and students are left dejected we decided to solve this problem by integrating a common registration portal in the form of a mobile application product description : a common portal for various competitions and tournaments across various categories debate dramatics sports technical etc it serves as an overarching platform to register for events across various categories students can search for events across categories and seamlessly register for them while saving time till now the only sources of notifying about such events were whats app and facebook spamming needless to say this cluttered approach did not help as messages were often lost in group conversations now students can simply go on to our application search for events by category and register for them it is a one stop solution with a simple and attractive ui the application requires a front end where users will register for events databases that stores the information of both the users as well as the competitions networking for making calls between app and database; all this integrated in an android mobile application weve used firebase for the database management and android studio for the mobile app development

jira and git hub both provide a web application protocol interface api which accept http requests and returns http response data in the json format the goal of this project was to implement a jira api querier whose methods could be refactored into a generalized querying utility for later use with git hub api instead of capturing aspects of jira bug improvements, these universal utilities were used to query a repository, and display relevant information about pushes, and the content of their commits this information was displayed on a local web server and servlet container, apache tomcat this project allowed for efficient reusability of code dedicated to sending http queries, as well as parsing the returned data in json format, storing it, and then displaying that information in a user friendly manner the project required reading and understanding the api documentation, learning to navigate json objects and implement apache tomcat web servers

nowadays the price of items in supermarkets and pharmacies are not very transparent to customers if people want to buy some products in an affordable way, they have to travel around all the markets to compare the price, which is quite time consuming and labor heavy therefore, we plan to design a public website, which helps customers to buy products in a short time and with decent price by searching the information on it our design is mainly composed of three modules the first one is for providing the weekly cheapest price of the same item in all well known supermarkets, such as coles, woolworths, target, aldi, big w and so on the second one will focus on showing the basic information of items as well as the comments or ratings from customers the third one is designed for customers to share their shopping experience and purchasing information we also attempt to launch it into the android platform our design will provide great convenience for customers to make their shopping decisions and choices

the goal of the task is to create model reflecting throne succession problem and implement class the class takes information about king's dynasty and returns information about a person that is the king at the moment of launching this algorithm the selection algorithm should be implemented according to male primogeniture rules please keep the solution as simple as possible you do not need to involve files rest command line etc it is perfectly fine if tests use object builders to create object representing king's dynasty and takes this object together with the implementation you also need to write tests for the implementation first you need to come up with a set of acceptance tests that you feel would be sufficient to prove that your solution works the assumption is that these tests would be run on demo session obviously acceptance tests do not cover all cases hence they need to be backed up with other tests on other levels unit integration system whether you will use all levels of tests or only subset it depends on your particular modelsolution

mybrary project description : mybrary is a simple library management system that allows users to add and check out books to users features include local search capability book status reports bookcustomer creation and editing and payment handling cool features : mybrary uses google books api to auto fill form fields when adding a new book if a field is not found the program notes the absence and asks for manual entry the program is capable of creating multiple copies of the same book using a single isbn each copy is assigned a unique my book id number for tracking purposes the program also tracks overdue books and updates all overdue charges when the program is first opened and displays a notification window if any updates were made if a book is more than two weeks overdue the book is automatically moved out of the active library and the customer associated with that book id is charged the full mybrary price calculated at 0 04 per page the sold record is then placed in an archive table in the library database for future reference the program includes a reports window where sold records can be brought up and viewed in detail through a series of listeners the program also prevents a book from being checked out more than once at the same time checkouts are for two weeks; renewals are for 7 days; then the book must be returned or it is considered overdue a book cannot be checked out for another 14 days while in checked out or renewal status; it must be fully checked in first the program also prevents editing of due dates or which customer has a book once it is checked out known bugsproblems : beyond isbn numbers or credit card numbers data validation is not enforced in the program a phone number could be entered as aaa asdfasdfasdfasf and the program would track it as valid the same holds true for names and email addresses i have j formatted text fields in place for data validation but i ran out of time and just had to get the program working the card charging feature is not very efficient at present because it does not connect to any actual credit card services the total amount a card has been charged is tracked in each card object the amount due on each book is tracked in the book object when checked in or sold the amount owed on the book is transferred to the card value it's not too sophisticated but it works

in this assignment you will design a simple dht based on chord although the design is based on chord it is a simplified version of chord; you do not need to implement finger tables and finger based routing; you also do not need to handle node leavesfailures therefore there are three things you need to implement : 1 id space partitioningre partitioning 2 ring based routing and 3 node joins just like the previous assignment your app should have an activity and a content provider however the main activity should be used for testing only and should not implement any dht functionality the content provider should implement all dht functionalities and support insert and query operations thus if you run multiple instances of your app all content provider instances should form a chord ring and serve insertquery requests in a distributed fashion according to the chord protocol

this mission showcases a basic mapping of a business operation to a remote endpoint by taking this approach clients leverage the http protocol as a transport mechanism to call upon services application engineers define their ap is using a broad interpretation of rest fundamentals encouraging freedom in design and quick prototyping as an application or service matures this approach may not scale as desired to properly support clean api design or use cases involving database interactions any operations involving shared mutable state will have to be integrated with an appropriate backing datastore; all requests here will be scoped only to the container servicing the request and there is no guarantee that subsequent requests will be served by the same container this is recommended as an introduction to the mechanics of opening a service to be called upon by remote processes

why micro services architecture? br ; ans : br ; 1 desire for faster changes : br ; in a monolithic application change cycles are tied together and releases happen probably every six monthsan year or may be at the end of the project modern business needs require faster changes and it is not possible to do that in a monolithic system br ; 2 need for greater availability : br ; all the codebase is not tied to one giant application there is greater availability the idea of micro services is cloud computing as a whole you can't prevent failure with bigger and better hardware mean time between failure doesn't matter as much compared to the time it takes to recover it is easy to recover a micro service than a monolith br ; 3 motivation for fine grained scaling : br ; in monolith we have a few scaling factors like db messaging tier app tier etc in micro services we can scale the ones which are needed br ; 4 compatible with devops mindset : br ; microservices are a very good fit if we want deliver the code continously through automation core characteristics of micro services br ; br ; 1 components exposed as services br ; 2 tied to a specific domain br ; 3 loosely coupled br ; 4 build to tolerate failure br ; 5 delivered continously via automation br ; 6 built and run by individual teams br ; qa : should every app turned into a set of micro services? br ; ans : not necissarily some apps that don't change much and stay in more steady state and don't deserve their own team and continous delivery then keep things as they are because keeping your effort doesn't make much difference qa : how do i find my service if ur is can change? br ; ans : in a monolith everything is present in a configuration database or a service catalog so manually can look at it that doesn't work in this model when many things are changing frequently spring cloud br ; br ; spring cloud is released in march 2015 it is a way to build common distributed system patterns using spring it is optimized for spring apps but not mandatory it can run anywhere like pcf kubernetes or heroku etc it includes lot of netflix oss technology because netflix is a leader in defining micro services note : initially aws did not have all the things that required for netflix to scale netflix has created lot of technologies and later collaberated with pivotal to develop spring cloud list of spring cloud projects br ; br ; spring cloud config ; git backed configuration server br ; spring cloud netflix ; suite for service discover routing availability etc br ; spring cloud consul ; service discovery with consul br ; spring cloud security ; simplify o auth 2 0 flows br ; spring cloud sleuth ; distributed tracing br ; spring cloud stream ; message bus abstraction br ; spring cloud task ; short lived single task micro services br ; spring cloud dataflow ; orchestration of data micro services br ; spring cloud zookeeper ; service discovery and configuration with zookeeper br ; spring cloud for aws ; exposes core aws services to spring developers br ; spring cloud spinnaker ; multi cloud deployment br ; spring cloud contract ; stubs for service contracts br ; spring boot br ; br ; spring boot is an opinionated runtime for spring it follows convention over configuration i e it mostly depends on annotation code than large xml configuration files the opinions can be overridden it handles boiler plate setup it has simple dependency management embeds app server in executable jar it has built in end points for health metrics
