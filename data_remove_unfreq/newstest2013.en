time spent : 4 5 hours took my time a bit difficulties : realized part way though that the flickr api was not returning a global id to do later queries against; ended up storing just the media url's for favorites and dropping their metadata working with some bits of the spark webserver still new to it and velocity template engine was easy but totally new to it trying to send back a json payload that contained a html fragment escaping properly was painful eventually switched to splitting it with double % in the name of expediency left undone : partioning favorites by users could be done by generating a random hash and storing it on the browser as a cookie that still only works for that specific browser so if they go to another machine the favorites are gone really would want to store by user id and do authentication but that felt like real over kill to add create account and login pages in the end stored the favorites in a setlist would be easy to extend that to map id set ; ; to support multiple users url's in page should be relative left some 'localhost's hardcoded paginating the favorites page should have a graphical display of when something is favorited vs not yet favorited feed is update at the top of the page every minute with a show more button at the bottom to load newer content there would have made it be older content if the api supported it ala a news feed etc to run : load into eclipse and run the flickr app controller java hit : http : localhost : 4567home

hack ust 2017 transportation category android application android studio br ; firebase database br ; solving traffic congestion in hong kong given uber's shared data we deduced that the surge multiplier that uber uses to determine price of a ride is directed correlated with congestion of traffic in the area so our idea was to locate various surge zones and identify these areas to the user give the user the capability to check the time of day and week of day on where high surge areas are if the user is in a highly surged area we will advise a path for the user to move out of the surge area to take taxi or uber this way the user can direct the taxi drivers and uber out of the traffic congested area helping diverge the overload of vehicles current features : the app loads with our customly designed ui screens and images animation to show loading which is currently preset with a count down timer the next screen will check whether or not location services is turned on and will redirect the user to the settings to turn it on our main screen has google maps and the ability to choose a week of day and time currently only the week of day function works and this will display every surge region in that day future features : carpooling but this is a sensitive topic since carpooling legalality in hong kong is special importing of more data to get more accurate surge regions currently is just used fixed data

although short term local measurements of 400 ppm have been recorded previously, this marks the first time since record keeping began that co2 levels were above 400 ppm globally for a month already we're seeing the deadly effects of climate change in the form of rising seas, monster storms, wildfires, and extreme weather of all kinds passing 400 ppm is an ominous sign of what might come next the safe level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 350 parts per million for our project we will first take the safe level of co2 as 350ppm we will observe an area or a zone to collect present percentage of carbon dioxide in the air using a sensor we will use arduino for collect data after that we will compare it with our safe point 350ppm based on this comparison we take a decision weather is good or bad if weather is bad or percentage of carbon dioxide is increased an text message will be sent to the governing members of that area saying that the co2 level is high in their zone and they should control co2 release of the area and plant trees if a week passes but still the co2 level does not stop decreasing or keeps rising in that zone a notification will be sent to the bangladesh environmental lawyers association saying that the co2 level of the indicated zone is increasing and no steps have been taken by using this system and dividing a country into zones we can keep the co2 level of that country in a safe zone and thus save our environment

i've just made a basic android architecture with some models class instantiated from json comming from web and displayed in recyclerview with a basic adapter i've been using volley to make web request because it's safe and easy to use wich was perfect for this fast task i've been also using picasso to display images because it's the best lib for that i had an issue with picasso wich was not showing pictures and i made a realy bad trick to do so replacing http to https sorry i think i've made 60% to 75% i didn't have the time to improve the cache part it will work a little bit thanks to volley but can be improved by using a background service to fetch and add a better management of it i could improve it with lots of design for the ui and should add test i've been missing something like one hour to do that

welcome to the landing page for a simple secure calculator you can use to perform all types of calculations and at all times br ; quick look in your pockets i can almost guarantee that you have a smartphone capable of doing more math than your feeble brain could ever do today's phones are more powerful than the computers that took the astronauts to the moon so why can we not utilize all the available resources on test and exams? professors require students to bring in a separate utility costing up 150 that we may use sparingly and almost certainly only in an academic setting with the rise in popularity of wolfram alpha and other digital calculation tools we humbly release secure calculator br ; to the student we offer a calculator that you can use in all facets of life saving you time money and stress br ; to the teacher we offer a secure utility that you can safely allow in your classrooms without worry of cheating

this app is a example of using open cv and artificial integilence in android this driver fatigue monitoring app driver fatigue alarm system utilizes camera camera image capture and digital image processing with its artificial intelligence algorithms it ensures that the driver will be promptly warned when fatigue occurs to protect life and property drivers are usually not aware that they are fatigued until the actual accident happens one of the most important functions of the early warning system is to let motorists understand that they are actually in fatigue driving and raise their alertness level once the system detects that the driver is under fatigue driving it will send a warning signal immediately to the driver in some circumstances a driver will probably fall asleep suddenly due to driving fatigue; the warning system will make a sound to wake the driver which is the other very important function of this system when the warning of fatigue sounds the driver must lean immediately to take a rest and avoid an accident if the driver continues to drive without any action the system will remind the driver sounding alert whenever necessary you can check the working app on the android store :

modules special builds can be created that exclude subsets of j query functionality this allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of j query are not being used for example an app that only used jsonp for ` ajax ` and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajaxxhr modules the current modules that can be excluded are : : : ajax : : : all ajax functionality : ` ajax ` ` get ` ` post ` ` ajax setup ` ` load ` transports and ajax event shorthands such as ` ajax start ` : : ajaxxhr : : : the xmlhttp request ajax transport only : : ajaxscript : : : the ` ` ajax transport only; used to retrieve scripts : : ajaxjsonp : : : the jsonp ajax transport only; depends on the ajaxscript transport : : css : : : the ` css ` method plus non animated ` show ` ` hide ` and ` toggle ` : : deprecated : : : methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed; currently only ` and self ` : : dimensions : : : the ` width ` and ` height ` methods including `inner ` and `outer ` variations : : effects : : : the ` animate ` method and its shorthands such as ` slide up ` or ` hide slow ` : : event alias : : : all event attachingtriggering shorthands like ` click ` or ` mouseover ` : : offset : : : the ` offset ` ` position ` ` offset parent ` ` scroll left ` and ` scroll top ` methods : : wrap : : : the ` wrap ` ` wrap all ` ` wrap inner ` and ` unwrap ` methods : : sizzle : : : the sizzle selector engine when this module is excluded it is replaced by a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's `query selector all` method that does not support j query selector extensions or enhanced semantics see the selector native js file for details the grunt build process is aware of dependencies across modules if you explicitly remove a module its dependent modules will be removed as well for example excluding the css module also excludes effects since the effects module uses ` css ` to animate css properties these dependencies are listed in gruntfile js and the build process shows a message for each dependent module it excludes to create a custom build of the latest stable version first check out the version : ```bash git pull; git checkout git describe abbrev 0 tags ``` then make sure all node dependencies are installed and all git submodules are checked out : ```bash npm install && grunt ``` create the custom build use the `grunt custom` option listing the modules to be excluded examples : exclude all : : ajax : : functionality : ```bash grunt custom : ajax ``` exclude : : css : : : : effects : : : : offset : : : : dimensions : : and : : position : : excluding : : css : : automatically excludes its dependent modules : ```bash grunt custom : css position ``` exclude : : all : : optional modules and use the `query selector all` based selector engine : ```bash grunt custom : ajax css deprecated dimensions effects event alias offset wrap sizzle ``` for questions or requests regarding custom builds please start a thread on the developing j query core section of the forum due to the combinatorics and custom nature of these builds they are not regularly tested in j query's unit test process the non sizzle selector engine currently does not pass unit tests because it is missing too much essential functionality running the unit tests start grunt to auto build j query as you work : ```bash cd jquery && grunt watch ``` run the unit tests with a local server that supports php ensure that you run the site from the root directory not the test directory no database is required pre configured php local servers are available for windows and mac here are some options : windows : wamp download mac : mamp download linux : setting up lamp mongoose most platforms building to a different directory to copy the built j query files from `dist` to another directory : ```bash grunt && grunt dist : pathtospeciallocation ``` with this example the output files would be : ```bash pathtospeciallocationjquery js pathtospeciallocationjquery min js ``` to add a permanent copy destination create a file in `dist` called destination json inside the file paste and customize the following : ```json absolutepathtootherdestination : true ``` additionally both methods can be combined updating submodules update the submodules to what is probably the latest upstream code ```bash grunt update_submodules ``` note : this task will also be run any time the default `grunt` command is used essential git as the source code is handled by the version control system git it's useful to know some features used

this is the android portion of the app we worked on at hack cu 2017 the problem we are trying to address is the lack of data and information coming out of countries where there is cencorship and internet shut downs these places are often occupied by military and have all sorts of problems with violence and human rights violations how can you collect lots of data to be shared with the world without any internet? our solution to this problem is to send information using sms on smart phones of course this relies on the assumption that people have smart phones and the gov doesn't just shut down phone communication we want a mobile app that sends sms in a controlled format with coded information information we would like to collect includes location several options that they can check such as assault road block sexual violence etc date time and their own description of the incident that they are reporting each of the options they can check would be represented by a 0 or 1 in the string of characters sent in the sms the point is to pack as much information into the 160 character sms limit as possible all the user has to do is pick a few options and write some text into a textbox the app does the rest a server with a sim card dongle would recieve these coded messages and organize them into a database we haven't figured out how to get this database out of the country yet but we'd like to have a website that takes the data from the database and puts everything onto a map obviously this is a huge project that would take a lot of people to put into actual use and there are still lots of problems we haven't worked out yet the hope is that we can give this idea to someone who with more technical knowledge and ideas of how to make this work at the hack cu event we really stuggled to get the app working because we are very new to android development in it's current state it is pretty worthless we also wrote a python script not on github yet that organizes text from txt files into an excel spreadsheet as they are added to a folder

with the release of hive 0 13 1 and h catalog, a new streaming api was released to support continuous data ingestion into hive tables this api is intended to support streaming clients like flume or storm to better store data in hive, which traditionally had batch oriented storage in our use case, we are going to use kafka with storm to load streaming data into bucketed hive table multiple kafka topics produce the data to storm that ingests the data into transactional hive table data committed in a transaction is immediately available to hive queries from other hive clients apache atlas will track the lineage of hive transactional table, storm bolt, spout , and kafka topic, which will help us to understand how data is ingested into the hive table

this description is based on that at adventures in c : the bowling game problem description create a program which given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of american ten pin bowling produces the total score for the game here are some things that the program will not do : we will not check for valid rolls we will not check for correct number of rolls and frames we will not provide scores for intermediate frames depending on the application this might or might not be a valid way to define a complete story but we do it here for purposes of keeping the kata light i think youll see that improvements like those above would go in readily if they were needed for real we can briefly summarize the scoring for this form of bowling : each game or line of bowling includes ten turns or frames for the bowler in each frame the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all the pins if in two tries he fails to knock them all down his score for that frame is the total number of pins knocked down in his two tries if in two tries he knocks them all down this is called a spare and his score for the frame is ten plus the number of pins knocked down on his next throw in his next turn if on his first try in the frame he knocks down all the pins this is called a strike his turn is over and his score for the frame is ten plus the simple total of the pins knocked down in his next two rolls if he gets a spare or strike in the last tenth frame the bowler gets to throw one or two more bonus balls respectively these bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn if the bonus throws knock down all the pins the process does not repeat : the bonus throws are only used to calculate the score of the final frame the game score is the total of all frame scores more info on the rules at : how to score for bowling clues what makes this game interesting to score is the lookahead in the scoring for strike and spare at the time we throw a strike or spare we cannot calculate the frame score : we have to wait one or two frames to find out what the bonus is suggested test cases when scoring x indicates a strike indicates a spare indicates a miss xxxxxxxxxxxx 12 rolls : 12 strikes 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 + 10+10+10 300 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 20 rolls : 10 pairs of 9 and miss 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 90 55555555555 21 rolls : 10 pairs of 5 and spare with a final 5 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 + 10+5 150

modules special builds can be created that exclude subsets of j query functionality this allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of j query are not being used for example an app that only used jsonp for ` ajax ` and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajaxxhr modules the current modules that can be excluded are : : : ajax : : : all ajax functionality : ` ajax ` ` get ` ` post ` ` ajax setup ` ` load ` transports and ajax event shorthands such as ` ajax start ` : : ajaxxhr : : : the xmlhttp request ajax transport only : : ajaxscript : : : the ` ` ajax transport only; used to retrieve scripts : : ajaxjsonp : : : the jsonp ajax transport only; depends on the ajaxscript transport : : css : : : the ` css ` method plus non animated ` show ` ` hide ` and ` toggle ` : : deprecated : : : methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed; currently only ` and self ` : : dimensions : : : the ` width ` and ` height ` methods including `inner ` and `outer ` variations : : effects : : : the ` animate ` method and its shorthands such as ` slide up ` or ` hide slow ` : : event alias : : : all event attachingtriggering shorthands like ` click ` or ` mouseover ` : : offset : : : the ` offset ` ` position ` ` offset parent ` ` scroll left ` and ` scroll top ` methods : : wrap : : : the ` wrap ` ` wrap all ` ` wrap inner ` and ` unwrap ` methods : : sizzle : : : the sizzle selector engine when this module is excluded it is replaced by a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's `query selector all` method that does not support j query selector extensions or enhanced semantics see the selector native js file for details the grunt build process is aware of dependencies across modules if you explicitly remove a module its dependent modules will be removed as well for example excluding the css module also excludes effects since the effects module uses ` css ` to animate css properties these dependencies are listed in gruntfile js and the build process shows a message for each dependent module it excludes to create a custom build of the latest stable version first check out the version : ```bash git pull; git checkout git describe abbrev 0 tags ``` then make sure all node dependencies are installed and all git submodules are checked out : ```bash npm install && grunt ``` create the custom build use the `grunt custom` option listing the modules to be excluded examples : exclude all : : ajax : : functionality : ```bash grunt custom : ajax ``` exclude : : css : : : : effects : : : : offset : : : : dimensions : : and : : position : : excluding : : css : : automatically excludes its dependent modules : ```bash grunt custom : css position ``` exclude : : all : : optional modules and use the `query selector all` based selector engine : ```bash grunt custom : ajax css deprecated dimensions effects event alias offset wrap sizzle ``` for questions or requests regarding custom builds please start a thread on the developing j query core section of the forum due to the combinatorics and custom nature of these builds they are not regularly tested in j query's unit test process the non sizzle selector engine currently does not pass unit tests because it is missing too much essential functionality running the unit tests start grunt to auto build j query as you work : ```bash cd jquery && grunt watch ``` run the unit tests with a local server that supports php ensure that you run the site from the root directory not the test directory no database is required pre configured php local servers are available for windows and mac here are some options : windows : wamp download mac : mamp download linux : setting up lamp mongoose most platforms building to a different directory to copy the built j query files from `dist` to another directory : ```bash grunt && grunt dist : pathtospeciallocation ``` with this example the output files would be : ```bash pathtospeciallocationjquery js pathtospeciallocationjquery min js ``` to add a permanent copy destination create a file in `dist` called destination json inside the file paste and customize the following : ```json absolutepathtootherdestination : true ``` additionally both methods can be combined updating submodules update the submodules to what is probably the latest upstream code ```bash grunt update_submodules ``` note : this task will also be run any time the default `grunt` command is used essential git as the source code is handled by the version control system git it's useful to know some features used

the apache struts web framework is a free open source solution for creating java web applications web applications differ from conventional websites in that web applications can create a dynamic response many websites deliver only static pages a web application can interact with databases and business logic engines to customize a response web applications based on java server pages sometimes commingle database code page design code and control flow code in practice we find that unless these concerns are separated larger applications become difficult to maintain one way to separate concerns in a software application is to use a model view controller mvc architecture the model represents the business or database code the view represents the page design code and the controller represents the navigational code the struts framework is designed to help developers create web applications that utilize a mvc architecture the framework provides three key components : a request handler provided by the application developer that is mapped to a standard uri a response handler that transfers control to another resource which completes the response a tag library that helps developers create interactive form based applications with server pages the frameworks architecture and tags are buzzword compliant struts works well with conventional rest applications and with technologies like soap and ajax

conversational ui for enterprise information systems please refer to the article : author : sunil vishnubhotla tags : conversationa ui alexa skill aws lambda apache spark past couple of year has seen the emergence of mature conversational platforms these platforms can understand the natural language spoken by humans while interacting with underlying software applications or passing on the messages in a translated format to the underlying software as commands a conversational interface or ui is any human interaction with a machine that mimics a conversation with a real human being it is the ability to transmit input to a machine or a computer via natural spoken commands that are no different from interacting with a real person the result is a desired output from the machine or software without having to click a few buttons or icons on a screen typically there are two ways of interacting with conversational platforms one is by typing a plain and meaningful sentence and passing it as input to the platform so that it can perform the desired task and produce the results based on what was asked the other a more natural way is by having a real conversation in this blog we will see how one can utilize conversational platforms for performing analytical operations and presenting the results in a spoken language to the end user some of the popular platforms that you may be familiar with are the apple siri amazon alexa google home and microsoft cortana we will use amazon alexa to illustrate how conversational interface could be used for analytics application fortunately adding conversational interfaces to existing business services that are exposed as web services is fairly easy therefore to illustrate this we will perform the following steps :

this mission showcases a basic mapping of a business operation to a remote endpoint by taking this approach clients leverage the http protocol as a transport mechanism to call upon services application engineers define their ap is using a broad interpretation of rest fundamentals encouraging freedom in design and quick prototyping as an application or service matures this approach may not scale as desired to properly support clean api design or use cases involving database interactions any operations involving shared mutable state will have to be integrated with an appropriate backing datastore; all requests here will be scoped only to the container servicing the request and there is no guarantee that subsequent requests will be served by the same container this is recommended as an introduction to the mechanics of opening a service to be called upon by remote processes

welcome to the machine data simulator this service randomly generates data in a range that you specify in order to simulate timeseries data coming from a machine this is helpful when testing services in the cloud the simulator requires the the data ingestion service leverages the reference app asset model and looks up the asset the asset model is a one to many of asset to asset meter each asset meter represents a sensor and the asset meter object has various attributes about it the data ingestion service traverses the asset meters and finds the one with the matching node name it then gets the timeseries tag attribute and pushes the data to the predix time series why do we not pass the time series tag directly? from experience we know that time series tags are transient for many reasons a tag name might change over time bugs changes to logic etc this is why we treat the node name as the primary key and do a look up in the reference app asset model in the future we will provide a bypass so the simulator can push the data to time series directly to startstop the simulator execute the following command cf start machinedata simulator cf stop machinedata simulator download the machinedata simulator service git clone build it mvn clean install launch the service locally java jar targetmachinedata simulator 1 0 2 snapshot jar

leetcode solutions the repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems from leetcode com i prefer to use java but may be i will solve some problems in other languages solutions do not pretend to be absolutely correct they are all accepted by leetcode com but there are certainly more optimal solutions for some problems i'll post a few solutions with different algorithms you can if you want add your own solutions or improve mine if you offer a fundamentally different solution it is better to add it to a separate class may be extract base interface if you just optimize my solution you can edit it and request me to merge your editions to code i use java 8 all solutions are equipped with tests implemented on j unit4 to build and run tests i use maven you can freely use the repository to study algorithms i also recommend you to register on leetcode com good luck many of my solutions look too monstrous this is because i am striving for more optimized algorithms for example i do not create new instances of string builder if i can just use set length 0 i don't delete and don't insert elements in arrays in string builders also this will lead to need to shift part of array elements i initialize collections and builders capacity if i can calculate it and so on it is a good idea to post many versions of solution optimized but ugly and not optimized but clear

this project provides a simple but realistic example of a kafka producer and consumer these programs are written in a style and a scale that will allow you to adapt them to get something close to a production style there is a surprising dearth of examples for the new kafka api that arrived with 0 9 0 which is a pity since the new api is so much better than the previous api this readme takes you through the steps for downloading and installing a single node version of kafka we don't focus on the requirements for a production kafka cluster because we want to focus on the code itself and various aspects of starting and restarting
