pathfinder a short example of path finding algorithms implemented in java : : you can try it live here : link try out different algorithms to see how it works algorithms if one take a look at the current implementation of algorithms one can clearly see how similar they are going purely java in fact the only difference between breadth first search greedy best first and a\ : in current implementation is a : data structure and comparator : which holds nodes candidates for the next expansion step and passing h n heuristic strategy strategy pattern used to get different heuristics to a\ : which always returns 0 turns a\ : into dijkstra's algorithm so even data structure modification is not needed initial algorithms description of course knows nothing about java data structures : : but speaking architecture wise it is a data structure responsibility to know which nodes are neighbors of the given one : : and we also can use nice and clean approach of automatic by comparator sort in java so we just get the best node from the queue without looking for the best ourselves : : speaking about high performance computing consider better structures like tree node for such tasks : : : : generally speaking about the algorithms and perfomance as of my experience in any kind of data you should consider the data set size when choosing the right algorithm the more instructions in the algorithm the more complex it itself if algorithm spends some time in evaluation part trying to find most optimal solution than gains would be visible only on a big datasets good idea also analyze the dataset itself before choosing an algorithm you may be suprised but bubble sort is much faster than a quicksort in certain datasets : : breadth first search is a blind algorithm may use more memory but always gives the shortest way greedy best first is one of the best first algorithms but uses greedy approach to find path in practice that means that it tries to move towards the goal even if the path is not right as far as it ignores the cost of path the solution is not always optimal under certain conditions greedy best first is fast and efficient and work nicely in a simple path finding environments could be also considered for pathfinding in certain types of mazes a : is another best first algorithm very popular in gamedev because it is very flexible and applicable in many cases it consider exact cost of the path so the path found is guaranteed to be shortest i e : cheapest : according to your heuristic functions the a\ : selects the path based on sum of two functions so called g n and h n : f n g n +h n where n is the last node on the path g n is the cost of the path from the start node to n and h n is a heuristic that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal if h n is always zero then only g n is considered which turns a\ : so dijkstra's algorithm heuristics heuristic term itself means good enough solution for immideiate goal the heuristic in pathfinding context selects the closest node to goal and there are many ways of how to determine which one is closer heuristic is a problem specific so should be chosen according to your particular case although you can pass any evaluation function to the algorithm the reasonable heuristic should consider graph configuration e g on a square grid that allows 4 directions of movement use manhattan distance but for graph with allowed diagonal moves it is better to use of course heuristic which is able to calculate diagonal movement cost like euclidian manhattan euclidian chebyshev

sleuth opentracing this project aims to provide a bridge to allow open tracing native instrumentation to work nicely in apps using the tracer it provides implementations of open tracings interfaces that create and modify sleuth spans caveats while 's implementation works on sleuth spans the following caveats exist : 1 it does not do the work to associate new spans with sleuths tracer to associate the span with sleuth a developer must call on the sleuth tracer with their new sleuth span 2 it does not make the current sleuth span a parent of the new spans it creates this must be done by wrapping the current sleuth span in a and pass it into the method 3 it does not do the work to have sleuth report those spans this must be done after you finish the open tracing span by closing the sleuth span with the sleuth tracer 4 it does not reattach the old sleuth span upon completion of the span you created this must be done by passing the old span into the method on the sleuth tracer caveat example

prctica sensores alumno : manuel de la pea d n i : 53 430 012 t asignatura : computacin ubcua mster de investigacin en ingeniera del software y sistemas informticos curso : 2016 2017 universidad nacional de educacin a distancia u n e d para acceder en modo online a este documento por favor visite el siguiente enlace enunciado de la prctica disear e implementar un nuevo sensor denominado mivelocidad virtual que devolver un valor enumerado segn la velocidad a la que se desplace el dispositivo que lo utilice descripcin de la prctica la prctica consiste en el diseo de un nuevo sensor mivelocidad que devolver el estado de velocidad al que se encuentra el dispositivo en el que se encuentra instalado el nuevo sensor mivelocidad define los estados de velocidad de acuerdo a los siguientes criterios : : velocidad mnima 0kmh velocidad mxima 1kmh : estado parado : velocidad mnima 1kmh velocidad mxima 4kmh : estado caminando : velocidad mnima 4kmh velocidad mxima 6kmh : estado marchando : velocidad mnima 6kmh velocidad mxima 12kmh : estado corriendo : velocidad mnima 12kmh velocidad mxima 25kmh : estado sprint : velocidad mnima 25kmh velocidad mxima 170kmh : estado veh motor terrestre : velocidades mayores 170kmh : estado veh motor areo el sensor dispondr de una configuracin para delimitar tanto el estado inicial fijando un determinado intervalo de tiempo para establecer el valor inicial como las bandas muertas existentes en los lmites entre los cambios de estado tanto por arriba como por abajo ya sea por recogida de valores o por tiempos por ejemplo para cambiar de estado de corriendo a sprint puede configurarse un tipo de banda muerta de 1500 msg de valores en el estado de corriendo para cambiar a sprint y de 500 msg en estado de sprint para cambiar a corriendo arquitectura de la solucin existen numerosos enfoques para abordar el desarrollo de una aplicacin en un dispositivo mvil para comenzar es necesario elegir la plataforma de desarrollo actualmente existen i os android y windows phone como principales plataformas de desarrollo aunque existen alguna ms con una horquilla del mercado extremadamente reducida en comparacin con las tres mencionadas como podra ser black berry debido a la facilidad de acceso a un dispositivo : android : as como el aprovechamiento del conocimiento del lenguaje java por parte del desarrollador se ha optado por realizar el desarrollo de la prctica bajo la tecnologa : : android : : de modo que para poder probar la aplicacin ser necesario disponer de un terminal con este sistema operativo mvil la aplicacin ha sido desarrollada segn los patrones de desarrollo de : android : por el cual las vistas se encapsulan en clases de tipo : : activity : : estas : activities : sern las responsables de disparar la lgica de negocio de la aplicacin as como de responder ante los eventos disponibles en el terminal como pueden ser los cambios de orientacin cambios de posicin etc para el caso que nos ocupa la actividad principal responder ante los cambios de posicin y en cada uno de estos cambios leer del sensor hardware del dispositivo el valor de la velocidad actual adems la aplicacin permitir definir unos rangos de velocidades de modo que se pueda identificar el rango de velocidad en el que se encuentra el sensor del dispositivo comparando la velocidad actual con los valores lmite establecidos para cada uno de los rangos determinando de este modo el rango de velocidad en el que se encuentra el dispositivo estos rangos tendrn unos valores lmite valores mnimo y mximo que determinen el rango de velocidad as como un nombre que lo identifique diseo del sensor para el diseo del sensor se han valorado las siguientes aproximaciones todas relacionadas con el tipo de sensor a utilizar para obtener los datos la primera es utilizar los valores del sensor que mide los cambios en el acelermetro este sensor que en los dispositivos android se identifica por : sensor type_accelerometer : obtiene los cambios producidos sobre el sensor acelermetro la segunda es utilizar los valores del sensor que mide los cambios en la velocidad linear este sensor que en los dispositivos android se identifica por : sensor type_linear_acceleration : obtiene los cambios producidos sobre el sensor acelermetro eliminado la componente de la gravedad por ltimo se podran utilizar los valores obtenidos del gps del dispositivo facilitados por las libreras de : google play services : en estas libreras se tiene acceso a los datos de localizacin obtenidos del chip gps del dispositivo y en funcin a la posicin actual y anterior calcular la velocidad instantnea del mismo que es un valor ledo directamente del gps del dispositivo si optsemos por la lectura desde los sensores del acelermetro o de la aceleracin lineal nos obligara a constantemente leer del hardware para actualizar los datos de representacin en la pantalla del terminal lo cual consumira muchos recursos sobre todo de batera en cambio si utilizsemos los valores obtenidos desde el gps a travs de los servicios de : google play services : reduciramos la frecuencia de actualizacin de esas lecturas ocurriendo sto en el evento de cambio de ubicacin del gps es importante destacar que este evento de cambio de la posicin ocurre con con mucha menor frecuencia que los eventos asociados a los sensores fsicos comentados con anterioridad por esta razn la aplicacin desarrollada utiliza los servicios de : google play services : para obtener los datos de posicin del dispotivo obteniendo la velocidad instantnea directamente desde este api limitaciones del sensor es importante conocer que el uso de estos servicios de localizacin tienen la misma limitacin que un gps convencional esto es el : : mal funcionamiento en interiores : : de modo que para disfrutar de la mejor experiencia de uso de la aplicacin es conveniente utilizarla en exteriores con cobertura gps desarrollo lenguaje de programacin el proceso de desarrollo viene definido por el desarrollo de aplicaciones android por lo que es necesario la instalacin de un sdk de android as como tener la versin adecuada de java respecto al sdk anterior de este modo el sdk de android utilizado es la versin 23 0 3 utilizando java 8 en su versin 1 8 0_45 sistema de build para la construccin del proyecto tal y como es habitual en los proyectos : android : se ha utilizado : : gradle : : en su versin 3 3 alternativas en el sistema de build para aplicaciones de la jvm el ecosistema jvm se encuentra dominado por tres herramientas de build : : apache ant con ivy como gestor de dependencias : maven : gradle apache ant + ivy fue la primera herramienta moderna de build en muchos aspectos es similar a fue lanzada en el ao 2000 y en un periodo corto de tiempo consigui ser la herramienta de build ms popular para proyectos java tiene una curva de aprendizaje pequea lo que permite a cualquiera comenzar a utilizarla sin ninguna preparacin especial est basado en la idea de la programacin procedural tras su lanzamiento inicial fue mejorada con el soporte para aadir plugins por otro lado su mayor incoveniente siempre ha sido el uso de xml como formato para la escritura de los scripts de construccin xml debido a su naturaleza jerrquica no es un buen candidato para el enfoque procedural de programacin que utiliza otro problema importante con es que el xml que utiliza tiende a convertirse en inmanejablemente grande tanto en proyectos grandes como pequeos maven fue lanzado en 2004 su objetivo era el mejorar los problemas que los desarrolladores tenan al usar contina utilizando xml como el formato de escritura de los scripts de construccin sin embargo es diametralmente diferente a en su estructura : mientras obliga a los desarrolladores a escribir todos los comandos que llevan a la ejecucin satisfactoria de algunas tareas se apoya en convenciones y proporciona unos goals u objetivos que pueden ser invocados otras mejoras y problamente las ms importantes son que introdujo la habilidad de descargar dependencias de la red que luego adopt mediante el proyecto este nuevo enfoque de gestin de dependencias revolucion la manera de entregar software sin embargo tiene sus propios problemas la gestin de dependencias que hace no maneja de manera correcta los conflictos entre diferentes versiones de la misma librera algo en lo que es mucho mejor adems xml como formato de configuracin es muy estricto en su estructura as como muy estandarizado la personalizacin de los es compleja por ello al estar ms enfocado en la gestin de las dependencias es ms dificil escribir complejos scripts de construccin personalizados en que en el principal beneficio de utilizar es su ciclo de vida mientras un proyecto se adhiera a unos estndares con se puede adaptar el ciclo de vida con cierta facilidad como contrapartida esta adaptacin disminuye la flexibilidad gradle hoy da existe cierto inters creciente en los ds ls domain specific languages en los que la idea es disponer de lenguajes diseados especficamente para solucionar problemas de cierto dominio aplicado al mundo de los sistema de build uno de los resultados de aplicar dsl es combina las buenas partes de las dos herramientas anteriores y construye sobre ellas utilizando un dsl entre otras mejoras dispone de la potencia y la flexibilidad de as como la facilidad a la hora de definir un ciclo de vida de el resultado final es una herramienta que fue lanzada en 2012 y obtuve mucha atencin en muy poco tiempo por ejemplo google adopt como herramienta de build por defecto para el sistema operativo android no utiliza xml en su lugar tiene su propio dsl basado en un lenguaje de la jvm como resultado los scripts de construccin de tienden a ser mucho ms pequeos y limpios que aqullos escritos con o la cantidad de cdigo repetitivo es mucho menor puesto que su dsl est diseado para resolver un problema en concreto : mover el software a travs de su ciclo de vida desde la compilacin pasando por el anlisis esttico de cdigo y el testing hasta el empaquetado y el despliegue en sus inicios utilizaba para la gestin de dependencias pero ms adelante pas a utilizar un motor de resolucin propio los esfuerzos de se podran resumir en la frase la convencin es buena as como la flexibilidad gradle proporciona : : una herramienta de construccin de propstio general y muy flexible parecido a apache ant : proporciona frameworks intercambiables basados en construccin por convencin al estilo de maven : soporte de construccin de proyectos multi proyecto muy potente : gestin de dependencias muy potente basado en apache ivy : soporte completo para infraestructuras de repositorios maven o ivy existentes : soporte para gestin de dependencias transitivas sin la necesidad de repositorios remotos o ficheros o : tareas ant y construcciones tratadas como ciudadanos de primera clase : scripts de construccin de : un modelo de dominio muy rico para describir el sistema de construccin de cada proyecto en el caso concreto de android para el proyecto no se utiliza nada fuera del estndar basando el sistema de construccin en el : default : que ofrece el plugin de android por ello las tareas de construccin utilizadas son : el diagrama de interaccin entre las diferentes tareas de gradle es el siguiente : diagrama de tareas de gradle staticgradle_diagram png en cuanto a la gestin de dependencias se utilizan tanto los repositorios de como la instalacin local de maven ubicada en organizacin del cdigo al utilizar gradle como sistema de build el proyecto sigue un especfico determinado por la convencin de nombres y directorios propia de gradle segn esta convencin la aplicacin est dentro de un directorio y dentro de este directorio existir un as como algunos ficheros descriptores como por ejemplo el dentro de se sigue una estructura igual a la definida por : : para el descriptor principal de la aplicacin android : para el cdigo de la aplicacin : para los recursos estticos de la aplicacin : layouts de android strings etc : para los tests unitarios : para los tests de integracin : para los tests de interfaz de usuario de android en la siguiente imagen aparecen los elementos antes mencionados : estructura de proyecto en gradle staticgradle_project_layout png por otro lado en el desarrollo de la aplicacin se ha utilizado una estructura de paquetes adecuada para realizar la separacin lgica entre los diferentes componentes de la misma a continuacin se enumeran los paquetes de la aplicacin que como hemos mencionado antes se ubican bajo el directorio del proyecto actividades las clases que aqu se encuentran representan la vista de las aplicaciones android se encuentran bajo el paquete una actividad es una nica cosa que un usuario puede hacer casi todas las actividades interaccionan con el usuario por tanto la clase activity de android se responsabiliza de crear una ventan en la que ubicar la interfaz de usuario de las aplicaciones android para hacer sto se dispone del mtodo del mismo modo que a menudo las actividades son presentadas al usuario como ventanas a tamao completo tambin pueden ser utilizadas de otras maneras : como ventanas flotantes a travs de un tema de apariencia o empotradas dentro de otra actividad utilizando : activity group : existen dos mtodos que casi todas las actividades implementarn : : : : on create bundle : : : inicializa la actividad y lo que es ms importante normalmente invocar el mtodo con un recurso de tipo : layout : definiendo la interfaz de usuario y utilizando el mtodo encontrar los widgets de la ui que se necesitarn a la hora de interactuar con ellos de manera programtica : : : on pause : : : es donde se gestiona el momento en el que el usuario deja de utilizar la actividad y lo que es lo ms importante cualquier cambio realizado por el usuario debera ser comiteado en este momento normalmente mediante un que mantenga el acceso a los datos en el caso concreto de la aplicacin existen 4 actividades : base geo located activity main activity range list activity range detail activity que detallaremos a continuacin base geo located activity esta actividad contiene el cdigo responsable de responder a los eventos de localizacin manteniendo en su estado interno la ltima localizacin conocida del dispositivo y que comparar con la actual para obtener la velocidad instantnea adems inicializa los servicios de : google play services : as como gestiona de una manera : lazy : los permisos que la aplicacin necesita parara funcionar como es el acceso a la localizacin por : lazy : se entiende que los permisos sern solicitados al usuario no en el momento de la instalacin de la aplicacin donde el usuario posiblemente no tenga el conocimiento suficiente para tomar una decisin acertada sobre la instalacin de la misma sino en el momento del primer uso del permiso main activity esta actividad es la actividad principal de la aplicacin extender la actividad anterior para acceder a las capacidades de localizacin y las extender para actualizar la propia ui actualizar la interfaz de usuario en cuanto se haya producido un cambio en la localizacin y la velocidad haya cambiado para ello la actividad dispone del siguiente mtodo que determina si tiene que actualizar la interfaz en los casos en que el estado anterior sea diferente del estado actual :

all questions or problems please send me an email at borisha zivkovic@gmail com intro one of restrictions given to me was to use jdk only but no other 3pp library for the main code this impacted a lot of my decisions i was given a choice between two programming languages java and scala i decided to use java because i am much faster in it and given the fact that i could not use 3pp libraries i had to be very fast and productive in order to implement all required features and also to have good code quality i did use some of java 8 features lambdas completable futures which are functionally very similar to what scala language provides requirements i developed this software using oracle jdk jdk1 8 0_121 it also passed successful tests with open jdk 8u111 jdk as verified in dockerfile below to run this software you need at least oracle jdk 1 8 0_60 the best is to use latest one available 1 8 0_100 or higher if you use older version then not everything might work because i rely on some latest feature functions parts of javascript scripting engine shipped with jdk to implement json parsing without using any 3p ps these are not specific to oracle jdk these features are standard features of any jdk implementation usually i would not depend on latest jdk version but in order to avoid writing my own json parser i decided to do so in order to support older versions of java i would have to write my own json parser deal with as ts and different corner cases and it that itself would easily take me few days to implement i chose to depend on jdk 1 8 and not earlier version of java because it has functional features similar to scala depending on specific version of dependency is not a problem anymore in the world of microservices and containers docker where every microservice can choose its own dependencies without affecting others as long as ap is it exposes are stable and versioned configuration it is mandatory to change first two configuration values in file srcmainresourcesmashup properties twitter_auth_key twitter consumer key twitter_auth_secret twitter consumer secret you have to do this before building and running software other configuration values can also be modified but this is optional how to build software? before building software make sure you configured it properly see previous step you have to have maven 3 3 3 or later in order to build this software maven must be available on the path to build software execute this will also execute j unit tests : mvn clean package how to run software? to run this software you first have to build it see previous step there are two ways to run this software : 1 using docker on linux if you do not want to install specific version of java then you can run this inside docker assumption is that you have one of latest docker version and linux installed this software was tested with docker 1 12 and ubuntu linux execute following commands in the root of project : build docker image sh run docker image sh this will bring you to mashup app where you can enter keywords to be used for searching github and twitter ap is 2 not using docker appropriate version of java must be available on the path see above for required java version if java is not on the path then please modify start mashup sh script and put absolute path to correct java binary there execute this to run the application in the root of project : start mashup sh if shell scripts can not be executed on your system maybe you use windows simply copy paste command from start mashup sh into your terminal command line tests j unit tests are executed automatically during maven build ideally there should be much more j unit tests but i was able to achieve only ~60% of coverage few more hours of work should be done to add extra tests and maybe refactor a thing or two while writing tests we would also have to add integration tests and system tests those tests would test network failures problems with dns problems with slow responses from remote dependencies etc this can be done by mocking dependencies using some kind of embedded jetty etc we would also have to add stress tests concurrency stability and reliability tests but this would make sense mostly if this was not single user console only application like it is today if for example this application exposed some res tful ap is to others then we would have to treat it differently than how we treat it now potential improvements introduce 3p ps and reduce code doing plumbing things like : json parsing and conversion caching metrics retries introduce proper monitoring and expose internal metrics some 3p ps would be useful to do this or maybe internal libraries in your company introduce proper system testing using docker and some scripting language like groovy introduce some kind of failure injection for more robust system tests like chaos monkey do local performance and stress testing and watch how jvm behaves gc hotspots etc try to optimize most obvious problems we can use jvisualvm for this use slf4j for logging for improved performance and richer feature set than what jul is giving us again jul is used because of limitations of this task probably move configuration to zookeeper or consul maybe currently using property files is not flexible enough especially for distributed systems if we decided to move configuration to centralized location then application should fetch its configuration when needed and not only at startup like it is doing today if we decided to use java only we could implement a lot of crosscutting concerns like logging or exposing metrics as annotation based api so that it is easier to focus on business logic only either use 3pp for this or some internal libraries already available other things that should be part of production ready software but i did not manage to do them documentation especially if we are exposing ap is remotely or exposing some client library this is currently not the case for this project but it could expand if we are providing user library then api should be clearly separated separate jar from implementation jars

simple di container simple di container aims to be a reasonable dependency injection container intended for small projects its main development goals are a minimum amount of magic and surprises and of course provide a sane environment for dependency injection features sports only constructor injection the main reason is : a constructor is a method that initializes an instance of a class in a manner that the instance is usable that means that the constructor is the only place where dependencies are meant to be injected furthermore it is required that only one constructor exists even if it has no parameters supports singletons not the crappy anti pattern ones with a method or member as you would think of in the first place a singleton in a dependency injection container is a service that is created only once as long as it's loaded by the same container you will receive the same instance is configured via a properties file because this format is supported by java directly supporting yaml json or other formats would mean to include parser libraries which would bloat the artifact configuration either you put a file named into the root of your classpath in maven projects and call or you put your config file elsewhere and call format sdic properties : service service one : com group artifact services service one service singleton service : com group artifact services singleton service service singleton service singleton : true the key for a service starts with after that a self defined service name follows the value is the full qualified class name of that said service if that service shall be handled as a singleton provide a key with the pattern and either or as value only services that are marked as will be handled as singletons so setting as value and simply not defining the key results in same behaviour all other keys will be ignored in future versions maybe other config keys will be added integrity check executes a basic integrity check while loading the config file following errors can be found : dependency cycles not satisfied dependencies all dependencies defined in constructors must be defined in the same container duplicate classes a fqcn may only be defined once in a container more than one constructor defined only one and exactly one constructor may be defined in a class no visible constructor found class not found the class for a defined fqcn can not be found at runtime license simple di container is released under gnu gpl v3 act accordingly if you do not know what that means check the provided license file

edu sharing importer rahmenlehrplan started as part of hack4oer on july 2016 the idea is to import the xml data of the school curriculum of berlin brandenburg and create from it a collection structure for oer open educational ressources within an edu sharing repo instance using the rest api the school curriculum of berlin brandenburg can be found in humanreadable version at : xml data sources : get it running clone git and import in eclipse as a maven project the most important code is the in the top area of the code enter the username password and url of for edu sharing account also you need to set the this the root collection below which all other collections should get created to get this id go into your edu sharing create and open the collection you want to use as root collection and look at the url use the you see there for the value also check that the account you use has the proper rights and the root collection is empty then run the java main script in eclipse simply with run as java application and you should see in the console that it takes some time to create all that collections preset the image background color and more for a collection if you check the xml data source you can see that every element that will be converted into a collection has an id you also find this id also at the start of every description of a collection created you can use this id to extend the configuration of the collection at the beginning of the script you can set the variable this is the name of a json file within the directory this file contains a json array with objects like this

mixer overview this application uses the microphone on an android device to gather musical information and relay them to the user when a song is played it will display the tempo bpm the notes being played and a graphical display which also responds to the music the settings menu allows the user three unique interfaces : 1 a google music search window which will start listening for music as soon as the interface appears and identifies the title and artist 2 a settings menu which allows the user to customize listening parameters 3 a tap tempo interface that also identifies tempo but using the user input from tapping the screen walkthrough when the app is opened it will immediately begin listening for sound it will calculate the tempo of the audio input and the notes that are being played in real time and display them to the user the app is not listening exclusively for musical tracks either the user can sing hum or simply talk into the microphone it will analyze any microphone input if no sound is detected it will keep listening the app will not shut down without input the play button at the bottom provides a test audio sample when pressed to demonstrate the functionality of the app it will either play or pause the sample depending on if it is already playing the colored lines dance and move according to the audio input for the enjoyment of the user they also cycle through a rainbow of colors the three dots in the upper right hand corner display the options menu when selected the user can select from three different menu options get song info song info allows the user to collect track information from audio input when selected it will immediately begin listening for music if a song is discovered the title artist album art and ability to purchase this song will be displayed to the user the user can return the main interface regardless of whether a song is detected or not settings when the settings option is selected the user can select the peak threshold level the silence threshold level and the minimum inter onset interval level using the corresponding sliders see application details for more information when the user has selected their preferred levels they can select the done button at the bottom and the application will save these settings pressing the defaults button will return these thresholds to their default levels if the user does not wish to save the settings they can select the back button in the upper lefthand corner to return to the main interface changes will be applied but not saved in this scenario tap tempo for added functionality the application provides a tap tempo interface as well tapping the large round button will register taps as beats and then the beats per minute bpm will be displayed the button will also vibrate when a tap is registered application details when the application is created a dispatcher object is created dispatcher is a class that belongs to the tarsos dsp jar library the tarsos library provides three objects to assist this application : a dispatcher a pitch handler and an onset handler the dispatcher collects audio input data through androids audio record class once the dispatcher has acquired an audio input the onset and pitch handler objects can be used the onset handler provides a method to call other functions when a musical onset is detected a musical onset is a cluster of sound that belongs together within a given decibel threshold which the user can modify in settings it will detect a peak attack and tail silencedecay of a given onset using a combination of decibel and frequency information if the peak of the onset is detected the handle onset method is called i used a bpm calculator object inside the tarsos handle onset method to record each onset peak and provide the number of beats per minute bpm the pitch handler provides the pitch in hertz as it is detected from the microphone from the hertz calculation in the pitch handler method a translation from hertz output pitch data to western musical notation is provided if the pitch is within a relatively close range tarsos dsp rounds the pitch frequency for ease of use of 12 notes in 8 different octaves the note is displayed otherwise no note is displayed the graphical display responds to user input by drawing the byte buffer array data input from the microphone onto a canvas in real time every time a new byte array is acquired the canvas on draw method is called the user is able to change three of the listening settings : peak threshold silence threshold and minimum interonset interval peak threshold defines the decibel threshold at which the onset is considered a peak the default is 0 5d b and the selector range is from 0 0d b 1d b the silence threshold defines the decibel range at which no onset can be detected the default is 70d b and the range is between 140d b to 0d b the minimum interonset interval defines the interval in seconds between when peaks can be considered onsets if 2 peaks are detected in the same interval the second is not considered the default is 0 004 seconds and it ranges from 0 0 01 seconds the user can save their threshold preferences which is done using android shared preferences a text popup toast will appear briefly when the preferences are saved the tap tempo interface also uses the bpm calculator class but instead of audio onsets the 'clicks' of the user are registered in the same way onset peaks are registered to the bpm calculator when the get song info option is selected an intent is called to the google now quick search box specifically the 'music search' portion the quick search immediately begins listening for music and fingerprinting the audio input with its database so that no other use action is required google provides this service freely but to my knowledge restricts manipulations of id3 as variables within the application manipulating id3 tag information titleartistetc typically requires paid subscriptions to music fingerprinting databases future considerations i want to discover the overall musical key of a songtrack using microphone sensor contextual information i presumed that if i could acquire notes that key was within the range of possiblity but in order to detect the pitch of an auditory input the pitch handler processes the input data using fast fourier transformations fft this auditory data is only capable of monophonic pitch detection if a chord is played composed of multiple notes only the dominant note will be detected which is not always the root the key is determined from the roottonic note and many chords are dominated by fifths thirds etc although the application detects prevalent pitches accurately and can display notes that are in fact being played it is incapable of detecting multiple pitches at the same time; and makes key detection extremely difficult i attempted to gather detected notes into an array and determine the key from the collection but when i used music samples of which the key was known the application determined key was incorrect the chords played in detected samples however did contain the prevalent pitches roughly 85% of the time this is still a useful functionality to have in the application as many songs that play the same notes are not in the same key the can be used for music mixing the portions of different songs that contain the same notes

hamming calculate the hamming difference between two dna strands a mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or copying of a nucleic acid in particular dna because nucleic acids are vital to cellular functions mutations tend to cause a ripple effect throughout the cell although mutations are technically mistakes a very rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute in fact the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations the simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point mutation which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide by counting the number of differences between two homologous dna strands taken from different genomes with a common ancestor we get a measure of the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the evolutionary path between the two strands this is called the 'hamming distance' it is found by comparing two dna strands and counting how many of the nucleotides are different from their equivalent in the other string gagcctactaacgggat catcgtaatgacggcct ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^ the hamming distance between these two dna strands is 7 implementation notes the hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length this means that based on the definition each language could deal with getting sequences of equal length differently to run the tests :

the masquerade ftc library this readme will teach you all you need to know about using this api if you have further questions you can contact me on telegram @an0n xm0us or email at archishou@gmail com : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : setup this document will describe how to use this api the first step to use the masq api is to configure your robot to match the masq robot class you must have at least two drive motors and an imu or some sort of gyro to use this system effectively first navigate to the tank drive class masquerade4997library library4997 masq robot masq robot open the file and begin to initialize all your hardware in the block of code that currently has public motor left front new motor left front and so on to create a new motor type public motor then type the name of the motor for example left front then new motor then type the name of the motor in your config to avoid confusion use the same name you used in the code so the full line would be public motor left front new motor left front in this manner all the sensors can be created with the exception of the color sensor scroll to the color section block for more info after creating all your hardware get rid of any methods that don't use the hardware you have obviously you can't use those methods : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : masq adafruit imu masquerades adafruit imu code is very easy to use to create an imu adafruit imu imu new adafruit imu imu to get rotation call imu get heading ; to get roll call imu get roll ; imu get pitch ; and to put any angle from a scale of 180 to 180 instead of 0 to 360 call the imu adjust angle ; : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : masq color sensor using the masq color sensor is easy once you understand how to use it to begin with start by defining it like a normal masq hardware object masq color sensor beacon color new masq color sensor beacon color after this the object requires you to type in the i2c address if you just have a factory color sensor from modern robotics type 60 and move on make sure to set the color sensor as an i2c device in the config if you have multiple color sensors or a color sensor that has the i2c address changes continue reading i2c addresses are encoded in hexa decimal thats what the 0x signifys to decrypt from hexadecimal multiple the first number after the 0x by 16 and the the a b c d e f after represent 10 11 12 13 14 15 add this to the product you get from the first number for example if you had 0x3e you take the 3 and multiply it by 16 which is 48 and then add 14 which is e 62 to find the i2x address of your color sensor you can use modern robotics core device discovery the resulting number will be you second argument in conclusion if you had a color sensor who's i2c address was 0x40 we would define it as masq color sensor beacon color new masq color sensor beacon color 64 ; functions : just like the normal color sensor you can pull the red blue green alpha values get the hue and saturation however with this sensor being i2c we have eliminated the issue where after a while the enable led true ; stops working the best part is the addition of color number a feature not offered by the ftc sdk that gives accurate color readings to use it simply call the function color sensor color number ; we have also pre built in is blue ; is red ; is white ; functions : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : dash board dash board is masquerade's custom telemetry system it can be accessed from anywhere in subclasses parent classes and in normal opmodes to create a new dash board type dash board get dash; from here you can call the create method or create sticky method create will act a normal telemetry however you don't need to call a different methods for just strings strings and data and an extra feature is being able to telemetrize masq hardware so the three cases would be dash create hello ; dash create hello motor get rate ; dash create robot imu ; or if you wanted you could get the dash of the entire robot by doing dash create robot ;these same arguments can be applied with create sticky however the arguments in here will be constantly updated and constantly tracked no need to call the update method : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : masq linear op mode the masq linear op mode implement the masq robot and dash board so its not necessary to create a new masq robot and new dash board for every op mode : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : masq limit switch this is just a hardware blurb about using the vex limit switches in the ftc competition to use a vex limit switch u must first wire a 1 5k ohm resistor between the power and signal wires red and white this will create a mini capacitor so you don't blow the switch : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : masq sensors for all other sensors you can create them just as you did with all other hardware and whatever data or things you may need to do just type the name of that hardware and the method will pop up in auto complete

demography analyzer background : in this project i have analyzed the demography of california state to find the following : 1 the county with fastest aging population 2 median age of each county from 2010 to 2060 3 predicting ca statewide total population age and gender wise 4 county wise change in population is calculated for an year 5 providing a infographics to visualize the data the required data was gathered from open data portal of california 1 and united states census 2 processed the 2 099 650 records each entry consisted county age gender and ethnicity information population projections were based on 2016th population as a baseline the projection data is available from the year 2017 to 2060 motivation : understanding demography provides better insights for organizations business owners often require demographic information to use in the business plans for raising the funds for businesses it is easier and effective to target marketing to groups of people with similar characteristics over targeting to every individual to give an example health care products can target the county with aging population and cosmetics companies can look for the age group of 15 40 city governments can use this data for demographic specific planning such as construction of necessary schools universities and recreational parks methods : it is possible to process the entire demography data in a single node it is not an absolute necessary to use map reduce programming paradigm however analysing the census data is a good usecase to better understand and apply map reduce hence decided to use map reduce programming paradigm to solve this problem implementation : each problem was solved separately in the map phase every entry is fetched and the data matching the filters only were passed to the reducer in the reduce phase the filtered data was processed depending on the query requirement 1 county with the fastest aging population : age of 65 and above was considered as aged population during the analysis county wise sum of people matching this criteria was calculated at the reducer 2 median age of people in each county for an year : the programmed to apply any filters such as ethnicity year and gender median age was calculated by initially computing the total number of people present in the county and later by finding the half using cumulative sum of the sorted list 3 ca statewide age gender and year wise total population : the data was divided based on age gender and year in the mapper and in the reducer the data was added irrespective of the county it belonged to compute the total population 4 county wise change in population the difference between the year the user is interested in to that of the previous year is calculated for all the counties in the reducer phase mapper phase takes care of filtering the data to match the query requirements 5 infographics infographics were developed using java script html and css d3 js and plotly js libraries were used to render the data local setup : : configuring apache hadoop 2 7 3 for running map reduce : mongo db for storing the data for the infographicsgraphical user interface : eclipse was used an ide : the programs were written in java : infographics were written using html java script and css remote setup : amazon ec2 clusters along with emr services were used for deploying and running the program on cloud amazon s3 is used for storing the input output and execution files core hadoop applications were installed on the nodes m3 xlarge instance type was used 1 instance of master node and 2 instances of core nodes were used executed map reduce by using streaming program step as well as custom jar step experimented with the number of reducers and mappers in two different ways 1 by configuring hadoop while installing : classification mapred site properties mapreduce tasktracker reduce tasks maximum 1 : 2 adding a bootstrap step : elastic mapreduce create \ name cluster_name \

my entry for icici bank hackathon 2016 proposed a mobile app with following functionality 1 a bank account is at the crux of a users relationship with the bank however, a personalized interface for the user with the bank is still not a reality i believe this can be changed once a common medium is found through this, we will be able to generate highly personalized data analysis to the user for free this can be represented as simply as a pie diagram or a bar graph through this, the user will be able to understand his expenses and also find ways to minimize expenses and save more money as there is a common medium, we will also find ways for the user to save and invest in the form of discount coupons for the users favorite restaurant, cinema hall etc we can also offer him stockmutual fund options suited to his monthly savings and encourage to do more with the data this information can be conveyed to the user in a form he is familiar with we can also make mock pitches that contain information post investment, mutual funds and its affect to his savings account ,etc this helps in finding potential customers for the bank all the information will only act as an advisory to the user and the investmentssavings will be at his discretion no such service is available right now 2 it is simple, fast and efficient from both the user and vendor point of view imagine being able to scan a qr on a bill to make a payment, without entering debit card details or getting redirected to a net banking website or having to open your physical wallet welcome to the future j

programming school android app people use smart phones and mobile apps every day to achieve different tasks this presents a great platform for engagement that can be taken advantage of to enhance learning yet there is a lack of mobile learning apps that embody principles of usability and learning most of the mobile apps for learning online offer limited interaction and user input this often makes learning programming through mobile apps a boring and ineffective task or people just simply do not take this form of learning seriously i present a proof of concept of a mobile app that acts as a learning tool to enhance the learning of programming languages the mobile app is based on a research i conducted on the principles of usability and learning my findings suggest that the choice of colors of the app the use of appropriate feedback and the frequent assessment of the learning outcome are some of the principles that could have major impact on learning these principles could potentially enhance the learning of programming through mobile apps and make learning through a mobile app more engaging to users running the app you will need to have android studio installed on your machine and you can run it from an emulator otherwise you can plug your mobile phone in developer mode and install it from there

implemented the following framework using apache spark streaming kafka elasticsearch and kibana the framework performs sentiment analysis of particular hash tags from the twitter data in real time for example i did the sentiment analysis for all the tweets for trump obama and show them e g positive neutral negative etc tweets on a map while showing tweets on a map i plotted them using their latitude and longitude sentiment analysis framework : scrapper kafka sentiment analyzer + spark streaming visualizer elasticsearch + kibana the above framework has the following components : scrapper : the scrapper collects all tweets and sends them to kafka for analytics the scraper uses a standalone program written in java and performs the following : a collects tweets in real time with particular hash tags for example all tweets with trump obama b after getting tweets they are filtered based on their latitude and longitude if any tweet does not have latitude and longitude they are discarded c after filtering they're sent tweets with latlng to kafka d used kafka api producer in this program e the scrapper program runs infinitely and takes hash tag as input parameter while running kafka installed kafka and run kafka server with zookeeper you should create a dedicated channeltopic for data transport sentiment analyzer sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive negative or neutral it's also known as opinion mining deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker for example president donald trump approaches his first big test this week from a position of unusual weakness has positive sentiment trump has the lowest standing in public opinion of any new president in modern history has neutral sentiment trump has displayed little interest in the policy itself casting it as a thankless chore to be done before getting to tax cut legislation he values more has negative sentiment the above examples are taken from cnbc news : used a third party sentiment analyzer like stanford core nlp javascala nltk python for sentiment analyzing added stanford core nlp as an external library using sbt maven in my scalajava project sentiment analysis using spark streaming : in spark streaming created a kafka consumer shown in the class for streaming word count and periodically collected filtered tweets from scrapper for each has tag performed sentiment analysis using sentiment analyzing tool discussed above then for each hash tag sent the output to elasticsearch for visualization visualizer installed elasticsearch and kibana created an index for visualization created a map to show all kinds of tweets after that created a dashboard to show the map dashboard requires data to be time stamped so when data was sent from spark to elasticsearch added a time stamp in the dashboard set a map refresh time to 2 min as an example tweets were shown for different categories for example if we have two hash tags obama and trump used different color icons for showing them in map used small circle with different colors for showing tweets

android a290 indiana university bloomington csci a 290 written by : : won yong ha : : exploration of topics in computing this course introduces the basics of android application development for common devices and will review design considerations creation and deployment of real apps utilizing mobile device capabilities including sensors : assignment 1 : create hello world project : assignment 2 : design your app with the required functionality given below : requirements : : create a multi activity app minimum two with following requirements : : : : activity 1 : : : welcome login screen should include text boxes for user to enter first and last names email address and password along with a login button and an element view to display the number of login attempts : prompt the user to select the background color and choose that color for the canvas of activity 1 &amp; 2 : ensure that user has entered email in correct format : save name email and background color in preferences and use that to update background color of activity 2 : disable login button after 3 unsuccessful attempts : upon entering correct credentials go to activity 2 calculator : load the saved preferences and display the name and email on activity2 : : : activity 2 : : should also have a simple calculator interface w background color chosen from user preference in activty1 along with one number box user may have fractional numbers and will use the same box for both operands and buttons for operations + : ^2 ^12 in one row add another button for operation in the row below the other buttons and make it as wide as all the other buttons combined use grid table layout for ui : display the entire operation string for example : 5 + 7 12 as user enters the operands and selects operations update when needed : perform the arithmetic operation after proper checks i e avoid divide by zero and other common errors show toast warnings for errors either add another activity or include this on previous activity : prompt the user to enter a date in future check to make sure that user has done that show warning if not and ask for new date using todays date count the number of days between today and the future date entered by user display the number of working days and weekend days for simplicity lets use saturday and sunday as weekend days : assignmet 3 : design only two apps with the required functionality given below : requirements : : : : app idea 1 : : : design and display a simple music playlist display application with the following : : use a grid view list view to display the music list : each music gridlist item should contain a picture of the music poster along with a description of the music below the music poster : when the app is launched let the main activity have a couple of options such as display playlist by genre or singer : based on the option selected re direct to the appropriate activity where the gridlist view is displayed to the user containing the music poster along with its description : : : app idea 2 : : : design a simple gallery app with following requirements : : create a grid viewlist view to display the gallery : each grid item should contain a small preview of the image when the image is clicked it should be re directed to a new activity where the image is displayed in a better size and the description of the image is also provided such as the timedate at which the image was taken along with the dimensions etc : real time data need not be used; meaningful data can be plugged in for the purpose of creating the app : : : app idea 3 : : : create a simple file explorer app with the following : : display the list of files available in a list view : create a list view of files in which each list item should have the following layout : : name of the file in the first line of the list item : date of modification along with the size of the file side by side in the second line : when the item is clicked it should be re directed to the second activity where the contents of the file should be displayed : for the purpose of creating this app sample data can be used and only txt files can be considered : assignmet 4 : design only one app with the required functionality described below : requirements : you are expected to design apps as close to the real to do and calendar apps as possible feel free to research different designlayout ideas on the web : : : app idea 1 : : : design an app called 3 minute to do list : this app will display a time dependent list as the name suggests : screen 1 overview : the app should be able to display all the to do items as a list at the starting screen it should also contain an option floating button somewhere on the screen to add another item the items should be contained as a list view from inside a fragment and should be clickable whenever the orientation is changed the fragment should change to grid viewlinear view the items are expected to have an expiry date and time which is displayed in a different format and alignment along with the item title and description they are expected to be displayed in chronological order by their expiry date i e fastest expiring one shown first : screen 2a add a to do item : the app should take us to a new item screen to get the required inputs from the user it should contain a button to save and one more to discard the operation hitting back at this stage should save the instance contextdata and restore if prompted to add the item again : screen 2b click an item : yes the items should be clickable and when clicked it is supposed to display two optionsbuttons to whether start the activity or edit it if user opts to exit the activity he should be able to edit the information and save it again if he opts to do the activity he should be taken to another screen 3 while one gets to modify the activity one should also have a button an option to delete it : screen 3 : it should be a plain screen with big text saying your time is running or something similar if you are ambitious you can display the count down timer of 3 mins for extra credit here after 3 mins it should delete the to do item from the list and display the rest of the list automatically if one presses back at this point before 3 mins the app should ask the user whether heshe has finished the task and then delete the task if they have leave the list unaltered if they have not : while displaying the list it should check whether the time has expired or not if it is expired it has to change its background color : : : app idea 2 : : : time table app mini calendar : as the name suggests the app should display a grid layout like a calendar as this is only a mini project you can just display one week the current day should be highlighted with different color the day tile should contain the number of classes you have on any day these tiles should be clickable the items in the grid layout should be from within a fragment and the view is expected to be changed into a linearlist view titled agenda within a new fragment and have the same required functionalities : once a day tile is clicked the user should be taken to another screen where heshe has a list view of classescourses on that day there should also be a floating add button on the screen to add a classcourse the courseclass should display name and time the list is expected to be ordered chronologically each courseclass item should also be clickable when clicked it should give the option of editing or deleting in a new screen with a save button when the save button is clicked it should save the information and revert back to the day screen again : at the day screen if the back button is pressed it should save the context and display the timetable screen so that if the day is clicked again it should have the changes unaltered hint : lifecycle functions override : if ambitious for extra credit the app should notify with a class title using the notification screen about current class details throughout the duration in any given day from the information entered : if ambitious for extra credit the app should notify with a class title using the notification screen about current class details throughout the duration in any given day from the information entered : assignmet 5 : complete one of the previous projects and resubmit the completedcorrected version : assignment 2 resubmission : assignment 6 : : : step tracker app : : : the project is a step tracker application where the user is being tracker using the step counter sensor user will trigger tracking either by using a gesture the user will be tracked until the user turns off the tracking which is again done by using a gesture thus the steps taken by the user are being tracked and presented : here is a list of features to be implemented : : the project should make use of map view the map view in the application will have a markerpointer for the current user location : when the user double taps or tilts or flings on the screen use gesture detector start tracking the users steps by using step counter sensor keep tracking the user until the user stops : the user stops hisher tracking by using double tap or tilt or fling gesture : once done the path the user has taken to walk should be displayed in the map view along with how many steps : along with the double tap or tilt or fling feature if you add one more feature which detects the shake event of the phone and starts tracking after a shake and keeps tracking until the user again shakes the phone or other gesture : assignment 7 final project : : : hike planner app : : : the project is a hike planning and fitness assistant where users can plan where to walk based on current location in a map and keep track of the temperature difference as well as get notified of to do tasks at each location simply speaking this app is basically a temperature difference tracker and to do logger app based on map view and gps : here is a list of features to be implemented : : display a map view in the application which shows the users current location : when the user clicks on the map the location should be marked the user can click on any number of places on the map all those places should be marked and saved numbers can be used if the place names are not available : when the user now clicks on the marked place in the map then a fragment should be displayed showing the edit text where the user needs to create his to do list of tasks : when the user is done entering to do list and clicks save all the items entered should be saved for that particular location similarly each of those individual places selected will have their own notes created by the user and saved : now you need to use the gps sensor and keep track of where the user moves if the user visits the location he had previously selected in the map by touching a place then the notes saved in that particular location should be shown to the user and the user should be notified a simple toast would do and the note should be opened and shown to the user for extra credit make the app to run in the background at this point and resume once the user clicks on app again please specify in a report txt file if you have implemented this functionality : also when the user visits the location the temperature sensor should be used to record the temperature at the location : when the user visits each new location the temperatures noted in previous location should be passed between places and the temperature difference should be shown this difference should be shown only when the user visits places which he clicked before on the map : finally after the user reaches each place in his plan he should be given an option to view summary of the hike so far there should be a summary page which shows the list of places the user selected in the map and the list of places the user has visited so far along with the list of places the user has picked and hasnt visited so far along with these details the temperature which was noted using temperature sensor and saved in shared preference or a file should be shown in the summary : this data should be present even after closing and reopening the app hint : save and reload the details using a file in the internal storage given below are some pictures to help you get started
